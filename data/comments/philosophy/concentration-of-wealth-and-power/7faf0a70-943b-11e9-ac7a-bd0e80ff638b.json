I believe we're in uncharted waters and in serous decline as a nation. With all the crime and discourse in various sectors of our lives, just look back at what happened to the Roman Empire!! We are in lockstep and doing the same things; government corruption, the masses having less control of their lives, the rich getting richer while the poor and middle class are being desimated, politicians giving way to same sex marriages, the destruction of family values, etc..... Because of our arrogance as a nation, it is just a matter of time when we will experience the same fate as the Romans!","date":"2019-06-21T15:44:47.999Z"}
