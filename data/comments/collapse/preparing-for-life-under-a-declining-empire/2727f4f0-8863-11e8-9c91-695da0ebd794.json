Like I'd hoped, you discuss both your vision and what led you to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat!  You discuss both your vision and what led you to it--maybe\r\nmore specifics re underground hydroponics w/ surface solar energy, and on your conversion from libertarian to demo-socialist--churches love conversion testimonies! .  As worship leader on 29th, I can choose some relevant scripture or other reading and work with John on appropriate songs.  If not complete before, we can finalize on 24th.","date":"2018-07-15T19:13:27.822Z"}
