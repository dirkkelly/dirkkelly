        Hello, I'm <span class="text-nowrap">Dirk Kelly.</span>
      </h1>

      <p class="h5">
        I want to live in a society where we all have input over the
        decisions that affect us, where we all share custodianship
        over our finite resources, and where we all strive to look
        after each other.
      </p>

      <p class="h5">
        I don't think that a small handful of people should
        control all the wealth and power in our society and
        decide our fate under a changing climate and collapsing economy.
      </p>

      <p class="h5">
        I think a revolution is necessary, in progress, and achievable
        if we work together to abandon all the systems supporting this
        unjust society.
      </p>

      <p class="h5" class="pb-2">
        We can do this by creating the necessary
        replacements of these manifestations of power in a manner which
        is collaborative, equitable, and cares for life in our ecosystem.
