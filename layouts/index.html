      I want to live in a society where we all have input over
      decisions that affect us, where we all share custodianship
      over our finite resources, and where we all strive to look
      after each other.
    </h5>

    <h5 class="mt-4" style="max-width: 35em">
      I don't think that a small handful of people should
      control all the wealth and power in our society and
      decide our fate under a changing climate and collapsing economy.
    </h5>

    <h5 class="mt-4" style="max-width: 35em">
      I think a revolution is achievable if we work together
      to abandon all the systems supporting this unjust society.
      We can do this by creating the necessary replacements of these
      manifestations of power in a manner which is collaborative,
      equitable, and mindful of life and the ecosystem.
