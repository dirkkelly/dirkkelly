I've headed over to Japan to go snowboarding with my friends.
tonight we'll be doing a try out of the new Saison batch, I'm
hoping to get some quality feedback from people who have never
had my homebrew before.

Maybe I can get them to add disqus comments, otherwise I'll update
this post with their comments once we've eaten our dinner and drunk
some of this Saison.

I packed four bottles, put two of them in my snowboarding boots and
another two in my clothes bag. Unfortunately it was going to cost
me about $200US to ship my clothes bag so I had to move the bottles
to be lose in my snowboarding bag. The bottles all survived the flight,
walking out of the Narita Airport toilet I managed to smash one of the
bottles open. Still three out of four isn't a bad effort.

Stay tuned for the tasting feedback.
