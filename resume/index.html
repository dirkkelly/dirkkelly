        <h5>When I Say Software Engineer...</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Full Stack</strong> -
          I have spent countless (about 6) years working within a DBMS, Web
          Framework, Application and the DOM environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Test Driver</strong> -
          My tests will guide me through a codebase; I test always, when it is
          necessary and never unnecessarily.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>User Focussed</strong> -
          My process prioritizes end-user features over solving problems
          that don't exist yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Future Prepared</strong> -
          I work closely with product teams to champion and promote
          quality time spent on technical debt and R&amp;D.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Self Directed</strong> -
          I don't need to be managed to produce results. I enjoy roles
          that split me between coding, training and planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>A Learning Teacher</strong> -
          I place a high emphasis on the value of pairing as a tool for
          teaching and reducing instances of code siloing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Open Source</strong> -
          An existing committer to many projects and I'll surely commit more
          in the future. I enjoy using and supporting OSS.
