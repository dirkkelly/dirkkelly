This brew was notoriously under carbonated, a result of my
immediate refridgeration of the bottles after capping, as 
well as a pretty weak effort capping them in the first place.

I put asside 12 in a cupboard, rechecked their caps and enlisted
the help of time to see if things improve.

Of course they did, and dramatically.

With that in mind I can now offer for sale a limited edition
four pack of this fabled no notes at all brew.

If you'd like to be the lucky purchaser, get in contact with me.

$16 for four, donate that money to the charity of your choice
and then let me know.
