When|What
----|----
1015|Collected all my junk
1030|Clean went fine, started sanitizing when I realized I didn't have a whisk or ice.
1031|Pause to stroll over to the store.
1045|Started boiling the water, I have no idea what 165F looks like, I figured it out soon enough though.

1140|Removed malts, added the extra gallon and started to boil
1200|Forgot to activate the yeast, it needs 3 hours. 
1201|Damn it.
1203|Turned off boiling junk
1205|Called Bitters &amp; Esters buy from, he said to activate now and it'll be fine
1205|started boiling again
