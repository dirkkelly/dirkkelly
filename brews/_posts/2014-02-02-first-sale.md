For Superbowl Sunday I'm going to bring a Four Pack of [Saison Ale](/brews/saison-ale/4).

Decided that I'm going buy it and give the money to [charity:water](http://www.charitywater.org/projects/).

I've discussed this before but this is the first instance of it
happening, I'm not in this to make money, but I would like people
paying for the non-samples in the form of a donation to a charity of
of their choice.


I sent the standard $16 a four pack to [Charity Water](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/general/thankyou/AoB89PHi).

Water is such a vital part of my brewing process and such a precious resource,
it's important that we support efforts to get clean water to all corners 
of the globe. I'd live you to know more about [charity:water](http://www.charitywater.org/projects/).

I've reached out to some friends who have enjoyed the Saison, I'd
love their support in also buying a 4 back by giving $16 to [charity:water](http://www.charitywater.org/donate/).
