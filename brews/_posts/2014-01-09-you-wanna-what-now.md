I want to give you the opportunity to take home some of
the lovely beer I brew. I want you to be able to share 
it with your family and friends.

And I would like you to support a charity of your choice
in order to do this.

It's pretty simple really, for $3.00 a bottle, or four at $10
you can take home the beers you sample at my home here
in Brooklyn.

Does this sound like a reasonable idea? Let me know your thoughts below.
