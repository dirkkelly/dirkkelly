An interesting dream the other night where I opened the Saison
and was greated with a sludgy vinegar.

I'm away right now, and will be going away again on the 10th, it
almost feels like I'm worried about my little cherubs sitting there
without me to look over them.

All said and done it is nice to have a hobby that gives me challenges
and rewards. I should be home by 9 tonight, and which time I'll be running
to the bathroom to check on the [Siason Batch #4](/brews/saison-ale/4).
