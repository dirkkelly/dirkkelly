Well one thing is for sure, I still need to practice my photo taking, apologies.

However the first go of the Saison Ale has turned out to be brilliant,
even if one particular neurotic brain didn't [believe it would](/brews/saison-ale/4/2014/01/04/my-first-beer-bad-dream.html).

This brew has has a definite spicy front, going into an
aromatic middle with a nice hoppy finish.

Its amber appearance only slightly sets it apart from the now legendary
[Red Ale Batch #3](/brews/red-ale/3) which was a holiday favorite in 2013.

I'm looking forward to returning to this brew in two weeks, for now I'm
onto my second Saison while watching The Hobbit as a recap from my Saturday viewing
(this has been my favorite of the ensite series so far).

It's been a rough few days after being trapped in Illinois, which I'll be discussing
more in my blog (there's a draft lurking in there somewhere already).

If you'd like to join me for a tasting, or just want to know more, leave a comment below!

I'm off to Japan tomorrow night, so it will need to be after I'm back (around the 20th).
