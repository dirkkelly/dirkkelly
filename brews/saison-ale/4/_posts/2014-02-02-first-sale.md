For Superbowl Sunday I'm going to bring a Four Pack.

Decided that I'm going buy it.

I've discussed this before but this is the first instance of it
happening, I'm not in this to make money, but I would like people
paying for the non-samples in the form of a donation to a charity of
of their choice.

I sent the standard $16 a four pack to [Charity Water](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/general/thankyou/AoB89PHi).

Water is such a vital part of my brewing process and such a precious resource,
it's important that we support efforts to get clean water to all corners 
of the globe.

It's absolutely taken for granted in North America, how long until
they realize it's not unlimited and inplement restrictions such
as those in Australia?
