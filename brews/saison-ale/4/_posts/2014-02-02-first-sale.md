For Superbowl Sunday I'm going to bring a Four Pack.

Decided that I'm going buy one, as with everyone that means I need
to Donate $16 to a charity of my choice.

[Thanks Dirk](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/general/thankyou/AoB89PHi)

I chose Charity Water, being that it's such a vital part of my
brewing process and such a precious resource.

It's absolutely taken for granted in North America, how long until
they realize it's not unlimited and inplement restrictions such
as those in Australia?
