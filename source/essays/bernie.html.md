# Vote Bernie 2016

I won't be able to, I'm not a U.S. citizen, so I don't have the right to vote.

That's alright though, I don't need to vote, I just need to be able to talk to
people about why they should vote.

## The Earth, It's Dying

## Racism, It's Real

## Wages, It's Slavery

## Taxes, They're Unfair

## Wall Street, They're Evil

## Socialism, You'll Like It
