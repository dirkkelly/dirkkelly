I've been doing a bit of work for our squares lately,
with the most requested feature being a Radiant installation thatâ€™s ready to go.

With that I'm introducing [www.radiantgo.com] which is an off the shelf edge installation,
packed full of delicious extensions and some initial data.

All you need to do is ... well go to the site and see.

sidenote: the webpage was deployed to [Github pages],
it's restrictive and basic, but meant the process took all of 5 minutes.

Eventually we'll move to Heroku.
