title: 5 Years of Snowboarding

Where I grew up in Australia it never snows, it wasn't until I was 21 that I first saw snow at Perisher mountain on the east coast of Australia. I was over that way for a work trip, we decided to spend the last day traveling 4 hours so we could snowboard for 1. I had no idea what I was doing, my mate told me to point the board down the mountain and figure it out, it was terrifying, it was amazing, I knew I needed more.

Later that year that same mate, another colleague (Barker), and several other people I barely knew (Nixon and Jones) took a trip to Hakuba Japan, the first night we arrived we went snowboarding. Not only did I not know what I was doing, I nearly impaled myself on safety railing as I fell down the mountain screaming "I don't know how to stop".

The following 4 days of the vacation were spent in lessons, the days were long, exhausting, and painful. I had difficulty standing up, no difficulty falling back down, and at first was only able to fall left (which would mean unbinding and running across the run to start again on the right hand side). By the second day I was in so much pain that I told my instructor "if I fall over once more, I'm going to start crying", she responded "then don't fall over".

I persisted with lessons and by the fifth day I was able to traverse the easiest runs with the other members of the group, solidarity in the pain required to learn the sport had turned these people I barely knew, into my advisors, mentors and good mates. When I wasn't following the correct form, they'd let me know, when there was something I could improve, they'd suggest it, when I'd made apparent improvements, they'd congratulate me.

Not long after this vacation my life was turned upside down and I moved to New York, following my now good mate Barker. One of the justifications of this move was that I would be able to experience a lot more snow in America, in fact before I left my soon-to-be supervisor emailed me to let me know of a snowboarding trip she was organizing. I signed up immediately awaited patiently my first trip to a U.S. resort.

That first day-trip was incredible, no longer did I have to take an international flight to access a good resort, instead I could leave the city at 4am and take a 5 hour bus trip up to the Killington Mountain. Again I built bonds with people that I barely knew and would later become good friends, and Barker and I continued to chase each other down the mountain, improving, falling, and laughing all the day.

For Christmas Barker and I went upstate and spent a day boarding a small mountain to teach our mate AK what snowboarding was all about. I was starting to get really comfortable on a board and decided it would be my last season on rental equipment. That summer with the research help of Barker, Nixon, and Jones; I bought my snowboard, the Rome Agent Rocker.

In November 2012 we went up to Killington again, it was a little early in the season but we were too excited to let any more time pass before we played in the snow again. I was anxious to try out my new board and excited to hang out with my friends, at the beginning of the first run though I lagged behind to help someone, which meant I then had to scramble to find everyone again.

Finally the sport caught up with me, and as I rushed down the mountain to find my group I took a blind turn, skid to avoid the tourists blocking the run, and threw my wrist down to break my fall. I felt the pain immediately in my wrist, even now as I write this 3 years later I can remember the pain, followed by the dread as I pulled my glove off to watch my hand fall away from my arm.

It was the beginning of the season, I was one week away from a snowboarding trip to the midwest, and I had broken my wrist on my brand new snowboard. Recovery wasn't easy, I ended up having surgery after the natural healing turned out to be maligned, I missed the trip, missed the mountains, and sat in my apartment while my housemate Barker enjoyed the holiday we were meant to be having together.

I was never annoyed with snowboarding for the damage I had cauased myself, I knew that it was a result of many factors that someone with more experience and patience would have avoided. I worked hard at my physiotherapy and took solice in repeatadly watching episodes of Adventure Time and The Art of Flight.
