# Dirk Kelly Theme

A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) temple for my website [dirkkelly.com](https://dirkkelly.com).

## Quick start

Install with `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirkkelly/dirkkelly.git themes/dirkkelly
```

Next, take a look in the `exampleSite` folder at. This directory contains an example config file and the content for the demo.

Copy at least the `config.toml` in the root directory of your website. Overwrite the existing config file if necessary.

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -
very handy. Spin it up with the following command:

``` sh
hugo server
```

Now you can go to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and theme should be visible.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-material-docs/) for the material Hugo theme I built this off.

A big thank you to [Martin Donath](https://github.com/squidfunk). He created the original [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for Hugo's companion [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). This port wouldn't be possible without him.

Furthermore, thanks to [Steve Francia](https://gihub.com/spf13) for creating Hugo and the [awesome community](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) around the project.
