  description: Mark Blyth (@MkBlyth), Professor of Political Economy at Brown University,
    joins us to discuss how understanding recent macroeconomic history, particularly
    the triumph on neoliberalism, led him to predicting Brexit and Trump’s victory.
    The Democrat bubble and how Bernie Sanders and Trump saw what the establishment
    didn’t. The technocratic story of how political professionals became detached
    from people. The scary ground being ceded to Tucker Carlson.
