Who wants their government to be led by people who's assets are hidden, who's financial transactions are conducted anonymously offshore?

Ordinary people are paying taxes, rich people are not. So this is inequality and this is leading up to popularism.

Today offshore is the way elites and multinational cooprrations conduct affairs, tax evasion is the way business is done.

This kind of cheating reuqires a sophisticated infarstrcuture of higly eucated people who think it's their right to help others to cheat societies.

We have a new mafia in town, it does not shoot people, it does not put bullets in their kneecaps, but it's trade is just as deadly, it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare, education, security, justice, and essentially a fullfilling life - Prem Sikka
