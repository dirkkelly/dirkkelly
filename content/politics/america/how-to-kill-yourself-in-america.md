Why would you vote against your best interests like that?

Why can’t you see that you need those benefits?

Why do you hate the government so much?

Why are you so protective of your guns?

Why do you want to shoot all the people at school?

Why do you want to fall asleep to Cable TV every night?

Why don’t you want to wake up, ever again?
