Recently [Democracy Now interviewed Noam Chomsky on Trump's first 75 Days as President][1], here's some key points I took away from it.

On the alleged interference of the election by Russia, Chomsky points out that America is constantly interfering with world politics and overthrowing governments. If Russia and Trump were to have a more positive relationship this would not be a negative thing at all, especially considering we're at a really dangerous time.

>  It’s a pretty remarkable fact that—first of all, it is a joke. Half the world is cracking up in laughter. The United States doesn’t just interfere in elections. It overthrows governments it doesn’t like, institutes military dictatorships. Simply in the case of Russia alone—it’s the least of it—the U.S. government, under Clinton, intervened quite blatantly and openly, then tried to conceal it, to get their man Yeltsin in, in all sorts of ways. So, this, as I say, it’s considered—it’s turning the United States, again, into a laughingstock in the world.

Only two days later [America attacks a Syrian Airfield][2] and [kills at least 9 civilians][3], enraging Russia and daring them to respond.

> People like [William Perry][4], who has a distinguished career and is a nuclear strategist and is no alarmist at all, is saying that we’re back to the—this is one of the worst moments of the Cold War, if not worse. That’s really serious. And efforts to try to calm that down would be very welcome.
