Apparently a bunch of executive orders to be signed at 5pm to drastically rewind the damages of trump. Which is good and is also politics.

I sincerely hope we don't have another 4 years of a president claiming "both sides" while the Nazis attempt to kill everyone and the progressives try to get them all healthcare.
