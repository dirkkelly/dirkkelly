I found a Youtube video of [Australian Communist Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WGjqOCxDI), which lead me to learning about Robert "Pig Iron Menzies" Menzies and his fight with Australian Union Workers over the shipping of iron to Japan during World War II.

> We wouldn't load pig-iron for the fascists of Japan<br/>
> Despite intimidation we refused to lift the ban<br/>
> With democracy at stake the struggle must be won<br/>
> We had to beat the menace of the fascist Rising Sun<br/>
> [Pig Iron Bob](http://unionsong.com/u150.html)

The communist party and union lead the people to fight against their government, they were impacting international policy in the name of peace, to protect the lives of the Chinese and their fellow Australians.

> They speak about it proudly, it's now union folklore<br/>
> How wharfies wouldn't load any pig-iron for war<br/>
> Japan was a threat so they walked off the job<br/>
> They wouldn't help the fascists for old Pig-iron Bob<br/>

Here's what how [Wikipedia introduced Pig Iron Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Menzies)

> Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, KT, AK, CH, PC, QC, FAA, FRS (20 December 1894 – 15 May 1978), was an Australian politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Australia, in office from 1939 to 1941 and again from 1949 to 1966. He played a central role in the **creation of the Liberal Party of Australia**, defining its policies and its broad outreach. He is Australia's longest-serving prime minister, serving over 18 years in total.

This guy started the liberal party ... what a Pig.

## One Hour of Australian Communist Music

Here is the video with a few songs that led me to stumble on this story and this union's media.

And finally I discovered that the MUA is affiliated with the [International Transport Workers' Federation](http://www.itfglobal.org/) who have a [Tourism Sector](http://www.itfglobal.org/en/transport-sectors/tourism/about-us/what-we-do/)

> Outsourcing and new technology are changing the face of the industry. For example, workers are being made redundant as electronic ticketing and computer-based booking systems become more widespread. Our role is to ensure that all workers’ rights are protected as the industry evolves.
