# [Being Julian Assange](https://contraspin.co.nz/beingjulianassange/)

> In 2016 an accused serial sexual predator ran for the US presidency against the notoriously corrupt wife of a previously impeached President – who is also an accused serial sexual predator.

> That these facts alone were insufficient to invalidate the entire race is testament to the audacity with which corrupt power operates in the West, and how conditioned the public is to consuming the warped byproducts of its naked machinations.

> Arguably the most contentious election in recent history, the accused serial sexual predator won.

<br/>

> No matter who had won, the global public was going to be subjected to a continuation of Barack Obama’s blatant lies and populist betrayals of his ‘Hope and Change’ platform.

<br/>

> This industrialised historical revisionism requires the excoriating of the public reputation of the virtuous, the sanitising of the compromised, and the constant manipulation of the living memory of both.

<br/>

> These are the core tenets of manufacturing consent. They aren’t just lying to us; they are already preparing the lies they will tell our unborn great-grandchildren.

<br/>

> That is why they are hated by those who fear the revelations WikiLeaks facilitates and why WikiLeaks’ public reputation is desecrated every day. It is why their every pillar of support is systematically undermined and why Julian Assange is being ever so slowly murdered in front of our eyes.

<br/>

> We, the people, are the last line of their defence. Part of protecting WikiLeaks – and ultimately ourselves – is to understand the relentless nature of the [psyops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare) employed against them; that the hardships inflicted upon them by the [enemies of human progress](https://contraspin.co.nz/glenn-greenwald-and-the-irrelevance-of-electoral-politics/) are not just reputational or financial but physical; that for those waging this thankless war of truth on our behalf, this is a matter of life or death.

<br/>

> ## This is a matter of life or death.

<br/>

> ## And that is why we must push back.

<br/>

> While many of their harshest critics hypocritically profess ideological support for the world’s foremost publisher, too few of us are meaningfully acting to free him.

<br/>

> ## Because doing nothing is a tantalisingly easy option. Taking action, requires guts. Blood, sweat and tears.

<br/>

> The lack of unity of purpose to save the life of someone who has himself saved the lives of many others, [including some we hold most dear](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/684931917263859712), has us all staring into the abyss of the greatest moral failure of this generation.

<br/>

> Yes, the agency infamous for destroying the lives of millions of people by engaging in every kind of malignant behaviour evidenced in human history, including countless assassinations and the active destabilisation of dozens of countries, now uses its press conferences to announce that the target they are after is not a despot, not an arms dealer, a war criminal or a drug trafficker – but a publisher.

<br/>

> Unable to directly abscond with his physical body in the near term, the powers that have been, for years, overtly threatening Assange’s life have instead turned their attentions to undermining other aspects of his existence: his relationships, his finances, his organisational affiliations, his achievements, his reputation, his ability to communicate and even the internal affairs of the country which has granted him refuge.

<br/>

> Part of the [Divide and Conquer playbook](https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/) is to fracture natural allies. We see this in the determination to sever the relationships between our most significant whistleblowers so that they can never become a united force.

> Manning, encouraged to distance herself from Snowden because Snowden didn’t stick around to face charges and/or torture and/or death. Brown, [egged on to hate on Assange](https://twitter.com/elimisteve/status/940397312215576576). On and on it goes.

<br/>

> ![Lauri Love Assange](/images/politics/contraspin/lauri-love-assange.png)

> Alleged UK hacker Lauri Love, who [in a historic victory](https://twitter.com/couragefound/status/960476126840836097) has defeated [an attempt to extradite him](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-42946540) to the United States, was swift to credit Julian Assange and the Courage Foundation:

> Lauri’s homage to those who dedicated years of their life to supporting him is laudable and the effort to emancipate him from the extradition threat [has established an important legal precedent](https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/966394571247759360).

<br/>

> By contrast, much of the digital history detailing the genesis of the campaign to free Chelsea Manning has vanished. Many of the key contributions of her original supporters have been bleached from the record.
