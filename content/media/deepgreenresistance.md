> Throughout history all resistance movements have faced ruthless enemies that had unlimited resources. And, unlike the past, now everything's at stake.

> We are battling those who are destroying the planet for their profit, not ours. Not all of us can participate on the frontlines. Many people have important reasons to stay back â€“ families, children, or character traits. But we all can contribute at some level. Here's your opportunity to Fund the Resistance.

> Any resistance movement needs two things: loyalty and material support. You have the ability to do both: to help shelter us, feed us, protect us from attacks, support our cause, and provide material support to make the whole thing possible.
