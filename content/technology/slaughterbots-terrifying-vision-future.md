The rate of technological evolution is increasing exponentially, devices which we couldn't imagine existing 20 years ago are now a mainstream part of life. Consumer product development is only one area of advancement though, and it's hardly the cutting edge.

All technological innovations of the past 50 years have been driven primarily by military need, this includes but is not limited to the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet), [Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography), [Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_unmanned_aerial_vehicles), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence), and most obviously [Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_weapons).

As these different technologies become more mature their shared capabilities are becoming increasingly powerful, so much so that humans are no longer as capable as machines in [many](https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/12/16138942/dota-2-bot-vs-human-international-2017) [different](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14358246/ai-poker-tournament-cmu-libratus-vs-human-losing) [fields](http://time.com/4960778/computers-smarter-than-humans/).

Realizing the potentially catastrophic impact of smart machines with the ability to kill at their own discretion, experts across all these industries have teamed up to educate the public of the importance of regulating and limiting the capabilities of these tools.

This video is a fictional representation of what our world could look like if we continue down the unregulated, unlimited path of creating machines that kill.
