## In the before time

I've been a gamer since childhood, starting out on friend's Nintendo Entertainment Systems and eventually getting a Super Nintendo, set me down a path of using computers every day since then, maybe I've had some days off here and there, maybe.

I'd bought computers before, saved my dollars and cents, built the perfect gaming rig, lugged it over the west coast of Australia (thanks Mum).

## University & Advertising

Hi I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC.

I was trying to buy my first laptop, and I was going to use money that I'd make building websites for people, i was going to be a business man with a business machine, and a University student studying Intenet Software Development.

I simply couldn't remember the details about other models, when you're making your own machine you know exactly which components you want, you have to know how they'll interact, whether they're compatible, what technical debt they'll cause your machine (shitty drivers oh man). When you're buying a pre-built machine you need to know the models, what differentiates them, which manufacturers offer what, the operating system becomes mandatory in this case, and I was a PC user.

Buying a mac would mean changing everything I knew about using a computer, I would be a n00b, and I would be using a machine I'd fought against for my entire computing life until then.

At the end of the day I hated the advertising for the other machines, they didn't make it easy to understand their lines, I went with the simplest option, and took on the burden of learning a new system, oh and did I mention ostracizing myself from my community?

When I opened my laptop for my first Graphics Development unit my mac boomed to life as loud as it could, I drew the attention of the room of Windows users, urg a mac user, in computer science, please.

And it was hard back then, especially in that class where having access to the same software package wasn't possible, not that it mattered, it meant I got to use Blender, sames as the Linux users, so I found some allys there.

## Moving to Ruby on Rails

I mentioned I needed my machine for work, my job was a partnership with another university student, high school fellow, and long time friend, who was a Windows user. One time we bought me a Windows machine, so that we could "standardize" on an environment, mostly I used it to play Battlefield 2 with him, the editing environment sucked so I just used my Mac, after all, PHP could be written anywhere.
