You're here because you know you need a website to publish your beautiful work, you may even already have one, but you know that you're not quite sure about **_the best_** way of going about building one.

I remember being 13 years old, sitting in my social studies class, we were each assigned a report and mine was on the Arctic. The twist was that we could present our report in any medium, I chose to make a website.

**I had no idea how to make a website**, so really my project ended up being: how to make a website with a bunch of penguins on the page. I don't have any screenshots of my first website, so I figure I can do that project all over again, and you can follow along, making something about cats, or paperclips, or your lovely self.

Making a website is a process, not a destination. In my entire career I've never finished creating a website; sure I've finished working on websites and I've worked on websites for groups or ideas that finished existing. But I've never created a website where I could say "yup this is done, is serving its purpose, and will never change again".

That's not to say that [the perfect website](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm "Space Jam Website") doesn't exist, just that a website is an ongoing project for its owners, once they release it, the act of keeping it alive requires continuously putting time and energy into it, making it a reliable and engaging source for whatever the topic is. In fact this cult classic of a website is a good example of one which was released, and [then never used](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/cmp/pressbox/pressboxframes.html), it was never really started, let alone finished.

So we're going to approach this never ending project of creating a website in stages, rather than trying to attack the infinite list of todo items all at once, we're going to prioritize getting something up on the internet, then we're going to worry about things like domains and SEO.

We're going to build it from the ground up so that when we want to make changes, we know how, and we're not dependent on another website or developer to keep things running. This post won't teach you all the things you'll end up learning over the decades, but it will teach you about the things you need to know more about to take things further.

**1. Creating our first Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page**

We are going to get our hands dirty, we are going to learn about the very simple language of HTML, and its even simpler companion Markdown, with these languages we're going to learn how to write the code that powers webpages.

**2. Storing our code in a safe place**

This code we write is going to be valuable to us, so valuable that we're going to store it in a safe place, and we're going to save our work. It's going to take some time, but we're going to know so much more about our website as a result, and we're not going to be dependent on other people to maintain it.

**3. Releasing our page to the Internet**

Wow step three and we're already going to be on the internet, the best thing about doing this so early is you're going to be encouraged to make updates, and quickly, so that it really represents what you're looking to create. But don't worry, nobody knows your site exists right now, so it's really just a cool new place on the internet all for you!

**4. Styling up our HTML with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**

At the moment you've got some text and a picture on your screen, but  I know that you know

**5**

**Purchasing a Domain (see not really free, but also not mandatory)**
