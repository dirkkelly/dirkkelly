I love Americans, I've even been _in love_ with a few of them, they are good-hearted human beings, for the most part, like all people, for the most part.

I love Russians, I am the son and brother of Russians, they are good-hearted human beings, like most other people.

I've never lived in Russia, I've never experienced their day-to-day life, their culture first hand, their language surrounding me, their food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, their entertainment and advertising filling my waking moments.

But I've done all those things in America, I've been doing it since 2011, for the most part in New York City, the native's self-subscribed "capital of the world". I've experienced a large spectrum of American life for long enough now that I attribute a lot of my hopes, fears, and weird way of saying things to being a quasi American for so long.

I love Americans, but I feel very sorry for them, I feel very sad and hurt for them, I've felt their systems of oppression crush me, like it crushes them, from medical bills, electrical bills (that weren't mine), debt collectors (for debts that weren't mine), media stations that lie, fear monger, and spread hate, and election systems that ignore the wish of the people, and protect undeserving and corrupt power. I've felt it all so bad that I just wanted to shut down, shut it all off, end it even, [like so many of them do so often these days](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/25/americas-opioid-crisis-how-prescription-drugs-sparked-a-national-trauma).

I have experienced the [learned-helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness), the [dysphoria of realizing that you're living in a hypernormalised reality](https://dirkkelly.com/hypernormalisation/adam-curtis-chapo-traphouse-donald-trump/), and the despair at the realization that if "things" continue the way they're going, we're all going to die.

But when it comes to this Russia narrative, I'm not brainwashed by their propaganda like so many of of them are and when I see things like [Hillary Clinton pushing for even more violence against Russia](https://steemit.com/hillaryclinton/@caitlinjohnstone/hillary-demands-even-more-russia-escalations-from-trump-administration), I get furious, and scared.

So does the rest of the world, so does [Caitlin Johnstone](https://caitlinjohnstone.com), who once again is calling out this bullshit in her article [The US Empire is acting like a desperate, cornered animal, because that's what it is](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2018/03/02/the-us-empire-is-acting-like-a-desperate-cornered-animal-because-thats-what-it-is/).

> The notion that the “collusion” between Trump and the Russian government is manifesting as consistently mounting aggressiveness directly against one another’s interests is laughable.

It is laughable, it's insane how ridiculous the narrative is, but not on the streets of America, not with "most Americans". Not because most people think that there is collusion between Trump & Russia, most Americans are just confused, they can't keep up with it, is Syria the bad guys? Are Russia helping the bad guys? Because Americans don't get it, their mind can't make that shift.

{{< youtube hn1VxaMEjRU >}}

The American Government/Military/Corporations are the bad guys, they are the enemy to all life on Earth, risking global nuclear war while ignoring the threat of Climate Change, the destructive evil of the American Empires threatens the survival of all life on Earth.

The reason this once well oiled machine is acting so destructively, being run by such an obviously horribly unfit Trump who beat another obviously unfit Clinton, after an election that could be at best described as, rather entertaining, but nothing like a democratic one, is because it is falling apart.

Like Rome, which they modeled themselves off, their country is falling apart; depleted of all its resources, and devoid of any of manufacturing industry, it relies on financial trickery and strong-arming of threat of violence to hold on to control of the world economy, and it's losing it's grip.

Don't believe me, think this is hyperbole? US Army Strategic Studies Institutes is going to disagree with you.
