I love Americans, I've even been _in love_ with a few of them, they are good-hearted human beings, for the most part, like all people, for the most part.

I love Russians, I even consider myself the son and brother of Russians, they are good-hearted human beings, like most other people.

I've never lived in Russia, I've never experienced their day-to-day life, their culture first hand, their language surrounding me, their food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, their entertainment and advertising filling my waking moments.

But I've done all those things in America, I've been doing it since 2011, for the most part in New York City, the natives self described capital of ... the world. I've experienced a large spectrum of American life for long enough now that I attribute a lot of my hopes, fears, and weird way of saying things to being a quasi American for so long.

I love Americans, but I feel very sorry for them, I feel very sad and hurt for them, I've felt their systems of oppression crush me, from medical bills, electrical bills (that weren't mine), debt collectors (for debts that weren't mine), media stations that lie, fear monger, and spread hate, and election systems that ignore the wish of the people, and protect power.

I have experienced the learned-helplessness, the dysphoria of realizing that you're living in a fake reality, and the despair at the chance of the world getting any better.

It's not the average American's fault that their government, corporate, military tri-factor is such a terror-mongering destructive monster, killing children daily with flying robots.
