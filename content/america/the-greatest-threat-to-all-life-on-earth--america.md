Russia is not going to launch a nuke. 

Islam is not going to kill western values. 

Climate change is already killing people daily. 

The American government will kill everyone if it can’t maintain its control over everything. 

War with Russia is not a solution. 

America has no right to wave a moral finger at any nation in the world. 

America is not a democracy. 

America is a corporate plutocracy. 

America is a dying nation.

Why?

Because all of it’s people are dying. 

Why? 

Because they’re no longer valuable to the capitalism system. 

Why?

Because capitalism values profits over all other things. Humans are transformed from problem solving beings that exist in nature, into consumers who reject nature for the benefit of comfort, of not being uncomfortable, of not hurting, of being numb. 

America will launch the first nuke, or at least, American intervention in the world’s security will launch the first nuke. 

Thanks America, for probably killing us all.
