## Chapo Interviews Adam Curtis

> We got to interview one of Willâ€™s favorite filmmakers Adam Curtis about his new movie HyperNormalisation. We talk about Trump, the curse of bloodless liberalism, science fiction, Escape From New York, living in the Zone, and tough medicine for the left. Adam was extremely nice and is now Chapo UK correspondent.
