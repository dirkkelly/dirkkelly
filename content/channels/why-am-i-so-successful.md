Nobody is going to give you anything, that's not how it works in our current society.

* Being rich doesn't mean you understand that.
* Being famous doesn't mean you understand that.
* Being liked doesn't mean you understand that.

The way you get anything is that you make the world change in your favor just a little bit every day, because that's how change happens, one day at a time, one tiny action at a time.

I am a Wall Street  Executive, running a $700,000 software engineering budget for the purpose of improving relationships between thousands of people around the world through cultural exchange, I work out of my home in Colorado and earn 6x more than the average American household.

That's not after some struggle, some struggle that made me realize that this system which creates huge levels of inequality is not a society that supports life. This struggle also taught me how to fight power, how to plan, propose, and enforce revolutions that change policy, and change the lives of the people around me.

I am the epitome of the American dream, I moved here at 22, with literally no money, promised a $10,000 allocation, it turned out that after the first $5,000 payment, the rest was taken up in tax... whoops, we forgot to tell you.

**Upon Arriving to America**

Fuckkkk, I needed that $5,000, that was how I was going to an afford to rent an apartment. What the fuck do I do now.

Airbnb you better fucking believe it, I lived day-to-fucking-day in hostels and strangers homes, I even unlocked a special feature "It looks like you're desperate for a place to sleep, we're going to send a notification to all hosts in the area, Okay?" 

**Okay**

Turns out I had a really good Klout, due to the small size of Perth I had quickly acquired these fake internet points on a website that I hope is dead, but might not be, who cares.

I started getting gifts in the mail from retailers, hoping I'd tweet about their products, I was homeless, but who cared, internet points!

I really missed home, I didn't have a place to live, and I was going on random dates every other night to try to feel some comfort from someone.

I eventually found a home, I borrowed money from my friend and we moved in together, I paid him back as quickly as I could, while having as much fun as I could.

Sometimes I chuckle when I think about wearing a Santa outfit on a pub crawl, but then I remember how empty I felt that whole time... drugs, sex and alcohol were a good distraction from reality, until reality knocked me off my snowboard.

**I broke my wrist.**

I was terrified, still I calmly called my mum from the bus  
"I don't want you to freak out, but I broke my wrist snowboarding"  
"Oh my god, should I fly out there"  
"No, I'm fine"

**I wasn't fine.**

I hadn't been fine for a long time, and now I was up against a monster, a final level boss that takes out so much of this society. The Medical Industrial Complex came at me hard and fast, I won't lie my employer and my client (future employer) were amazing, I couldn't be more grateful for the support they gave me... but my health insurance...

It's a war, and you, the broken human being who is in pain, is caught in the middle. Two massive organizations, your hospital and your health insurance, they hate each other, and the best place to put their hatred (their costs) is on you, the child-adult with a broken wrist and no family to look after him. 

**I had a very good American lady look after me, K I will always appreciate you.**

But that didn't stop it from destroying me, from crushing my spirit and optimism, from taking away the distraction of reality.

**This country hates me, I am alone here, and it is scary.**
