I heard about Matt Bruenig's work through Chapo Trap House, something I admittedly need to post a lot more of.

> Peopleâ€™s Policy Project (3P) is a think tank founded in 2017. The primary mission of 3P is to publish ideas and analysis that assist in the development of an economic system that serves the many, not the few.

Policy is the most important aspect of any government and if we continue to allow the rich and powerful to define the rules of our society then we will continue to lose our rights. If you can I urge you to support the research of 3P via the [People's Policy Project Patreon](https://patreon.com/peoplespolicyproject).
