Trump is proving to be the perfect distraction for the Republican party, he creates
outrageous executive orders that consumes the public's social media feeds.

In the meantime the Republican controlled government carry out their systematic
destruction of the services that were keeping America from both starting a nuclear
war and bringing upon climate change harder and faster than ever.
