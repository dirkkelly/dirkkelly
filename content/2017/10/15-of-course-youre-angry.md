People are blowing up at each other all through this country, mad at one another for their opposing perspectives on the world, on their ideas of solutions to the problems they see.

While the perspectives on solutions vary across the political spectrum, the problems are not unique to one group. The fear of immigration forcing one to lose their identity and privileges is very similar to the fear of discrimination and deportation.

You should be angry, the policies that are being forced on us do not help anybody but those in very privileged positions.

### High Skilled Immigration

Increasing immigration into the country for things like software engineering don't greatly improve the lives of people, forcing them to leave their families and homes in order to chase work. What is does do though is increase the amount of competition in localized markets, drive down the value of software engineers, and export the responsibility of educating those people to other nations with functioning education systems. The winners are the owners of software companies, student loan services, and colleges, who exploit Americans with the need for an over-priced student loans to compete with immigrants willing to take lower salaries in order to make something to support themselves and their communities.

I'm a foreigner, here for 6 years, with a highly paid job (the equivalent of over 4 average U.S.  household incomes). I left my hometown of Perth because there was little valued programming work out there, because the manufacturing has been centralized in places like New York and San Francisco, where the markets are artificially inflated to extract the wealth back out of the workers, and subsequently displace lower classes American's who are less valuable to the rent seekers.
