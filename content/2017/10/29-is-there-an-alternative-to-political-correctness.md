What an amazing video for such a controversial topic right now, Political Correctness is a term so grating in our society that it forces an immediate division into each side of the [Culture War](/tags/culture-war).

[Politeness](/tags/politeness) a more holistic approach the problems that political correctness tries to solve, instead of focusing empathy towards a select group of under-represented people, it distributes empathy all members of society.

Additional to this it allows each person accept that they have privilege without being demonized for it, understand that their thoughts are not their actions, and encourage them to demostrate politeness through their actions.

Politeness is a key tool for the progressive culture which is tasked with not only changing the norms of a society, but bringing along all those that will be impacted by those changes in a non-violent way. Even if one doesn't necessarily agree with progressions made by the culture, they understand that a polite society includes everyone.
