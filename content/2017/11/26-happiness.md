Don't have enough time to watch the [film noir masterpiece BladeRunner 2049](http://thephilosophicalsalon.com/blade-runner-2049-a-view-of-post-human-capitalism/), still curious as to how our future is being shaped, and where it's headed?

I think these two films together perfectly sum up how people don't think about changing the world they live in, and how the world they live in treats them.
