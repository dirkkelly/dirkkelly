[the HipCrime Vocab](http://hipcrimevocab.com) just completed an insightful and dense series [The Origins of Money](http://hipcrimevocab.com/2017/11/10/the-origin-of-money-key-takeaways/), and at ten posts, I have to same I'm relieved that's it come to an end :p

Thankfully there's a recap post of the [key takeaways of these essays](http://hipcrimevocab.com/2017/11/10/the-origin-of-money-key-takeaways/).

Before getting into that though, I think we need to answer the question.
**What's a hipCrime?** Well you committed one when you opened this blog. Keep it up, it's our only hope!

Seriously though, this blog contains in-depth analysis of our society, where power came from, how it is distributed, and the ways in which the systems enforce control.

Money is a very tangible example in everybody's lives of power, and as this article goes on to explain that's the only purpose for money, to funnel power and control.

> Money emerges when one class is able to impose obligations on the rest of society.

We live in a time of incredible wealth disparity between a very small percentage of the population and the rest of the world. Increasingly the life of an average human is getting worse, while those in the dominating classes amass so much wealth and power they have been able to drive the policies of governments all over the world, notably the richest one, the USA.

> Money has no value in and of itself. It is not the thing that matters, but the ability of one section of the population to impose its standard on the majority, and the institutions through which that majority accepts the will of the minority. Money, then as a unit of account, represents the class relations that developed in Egypt (and elsewhere), and class relations are social relations.

I live in a small city in Colorado and I am constantly meeting people who are angry at the state of the world, are scared of their future, who want to see change, but see no way to make that change happen.

> Apart from its role in the invention of writing, accounting is significant for human civilization because it affects the way we see the world and shapes our beliefs.

I understand the rage, misery, and fear that people are feeling, because I feel them myself. However giving in to those feelings is not the way to create change, and if you're truly upset with the state of the world, it's your responsibility to try to be involved in making change.

One of the most important parts of my mental health care regime is education, and I do that in a variety of ways that are no different to what a lot of us do on the Internet.

I watch [YouTube](https://youtube.com/contrapoints), I follow [Reddit](https://reddit.com/latestagecapitalism), and I read [blogs](http://hipcrimevocab.com).

But I do those things with the purpose of understanding the oppression in our modern world, so that I can eventually work with others to dismantle the systems that serve only the few and replace them with systems that serve everyone, equally, out in the open.

> ...the rise of class society and inequality took place alongside the emergence of money, whereby money played a key role in establishing, maintaining and exacerbating inequality and class division in societies. To put it simply, as soon as one witnesses the emergence of money, one observes the rise of class society and economic inequalities. Money, class society, and inequality came into being simultaneously, so it seems, mutually reinforcing the development of one another. [Semenova and Wray, The Rise of Money and Class Society: The Contributions of John F. Henry](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiH2dWCiLPXAhXEPiYKHRMxDz4QFgguMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.levyinstitute.org%2Fpubs%2Fwp_832.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0SAdfdjZ1FDqzkBcK03lzA) (PDF) p.2

Both of those sides of the fight (bringing down and raising up), require a significant amount of research and planning, otherwise we risk replacing systems of oppression, with more systems of oppression.

Before you rise up, educate yourself to understand what it is you're fighting against and fighting for, [the HipCrime Vocab](http://hipcrimevocab.com) should be a key part of your education.
