[the HipCrime Vocab](http://hipcrimevocab.com) just completed an insightful and dense series [The Origins of Money](http://hipcrimevocab.com/2017/11/10/the-origin-of-money-key-takeaways/), and I have to same I'm relieved that's it come to an end.

Before jumping into the key takeaways of this essay, I need to answer the question, **what's a hipCrime?** Well you committed one when you opened this blog. Keep it up, it's our only hope!

Seriously though, this blog contains in-depth analysis of our society, where power came from, how it is distributed, and the ways in which the systems of power enforce their control.

Money is a very tangible example in everybody's lives of power, and as this article goes on to explain that's the only purpose for money, to funnel power.

> Money emerges when one class is able to impose obligations on the rest of society.

We live in a time of incredible wealth disparity between a very small percentage of the population and the rest of the world. Increasingly the life of an average human is getting worse, while those in the dominating classes amass so much wealth and power they have been able to drive the policies of governments all over the world, notably the richest one, the USA.

I am increasingly meeting young people who are angry at the state of the world, are scared of the future and what it will bring to them, who want to see change, but see no way to make that change happen.

I understand the rage, misery, and fear that people are feeling, because I feel them myself all the time. However giving in to those feelings is not the way to create change, and if you're truly upset with the state of the world, it's your responsibility to try to be involved in that change.

One of the most important parts of my mental health care regime is education, and I do that in a variety of ways that are no different to what all of us do on the internet.

I watch [YouTube](https://youtube.com/contrapoints), I follow [Reddit](https://reddit.com/latestagecapitalism), and I read [blogs](http://hipcrimevocab.com).

But I do those things with the purpose of understanding the systems of oppression in our world, so that I can eventually work with others to dismantle the broken systems that serve only the few and replace them with systems that serve everyone, equally, in the open.

Both of those sides of the fight require a significant amount of understanding, otherwise we risk replacing systems of oppression, with more systems of oppression. Which is what we do if we don't plan and execute our revolutions effectively, because it's whats happened so many times before.

We now live in an age of corporate tyranny, it's no different really than the feudal days of kingdoms, with their elite few, and masses of serfs.

Before you rise up, educate yourself to understand what it is your fighting against and fighting for, [the HipCrime Vocab](http://hipcrimevocab.com) should be a key part of your education.
