Well the Deep Green Resistance strategy has two main goals

I think it's very important in political movements to actually have a goal

we have two goals and the first goal is that we aim to deprive the rich of the their ability to steal from the poor and the powerful of their ability to destroy the planet

the second goal is to repair and restore what's been destroyed of our planet

to restore cultures that know how to live as members of those biotic communities instead of as dominators who destroy

The Strategy is one of attacking the roots of civilization to bring it down and at the same time working to establish the roots in the soil for what will come after

we need to be building a culture of resistance that can sustain the potential for resistance and nurture resistance in all its forms in the years to come

you need to take something away from the powerful they've got it all we don't have a lot and that is done by force

power is not a mistake and it's not a misunderstanding which is to say that social change doesn't happen by personal epiphany or some kind of spiritual revelation or even by rational discussion

because it's not a misunderstanding right it happens when you take power away from the powerful and you redistribute it to the people who are disempowered and that is always going to require some degree of force

because we don't have the numbers for nonviolent resistance we look at this industrial civilization and we say this system is vulnerable there's a lot of different weak points that you could attack in order to take it down and a lot of those have to do with energy flows, fossil fuel, electricity, communication, global finance these systems that give the give the system its strength but they also make it vulnerable

Wars being raised against the natural world and you don't stop wars primarily by simply asking one of the ways you stop a war is by destroying an enemy's ability to wage that war

the reason that we know the strategy could work is that we talked to people who have been involved in the military we talked to veterans people who've studied military tactics and strategy in history

going after critical nodes of infrastructure is a classic technique that's been used hundreds or even thousands of times throughout history to win large-scale conflicts

especially asymmetric conflicts and what that means is one side has way more power than the other side and obviously this is this is that sort of situation

part of the problem is that too many of us don't yet perceive this as war being waged against the natural world and part of the reason too many of us don't perceive that is because we are the beneficiaries of this war and I guarantee that if we were salmon or if we were blue whales

or if we were monarch butterflies we would understand that it's war being waged against the world

we're asking people not to withdraw into personal despair and personal purity because those are dead ends

there's got to be a strategy that will work we don't tend to give up until it's over and
therefore we aren't we are at least asking people to consider that more militant action may be necessary at this point in time

because we don't see that we've got enough people to actually use civil disobedience in a way that might be effective the people who might take up an underground are not us so don't come to us asking to join the underground we can't help you

but if you have the skills and you have the personality the character for it we would hope that somebody somewhere might consider using those more militant tactics and

what we're talking about is property destruction I'm not in any way talking about harm to humans or other sentient beings I think that this can be done without any harm to people people are not the enemy here

what is the enemy is a vast system called industrial civilization and that system

is utterly dependent on fossil fuel at this point which is why I think it's doable the nodes are very obvious

so if somebody wants to think about that then that's what we are in trying to encourage is at least a discussion and environmental movement about taking up alternate tactics before it's too late
