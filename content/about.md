My goal is to learn and provide support in the areas of technology, business, and philosophy; and by philosophy I mean nothing more fancy than trying to understand what it is to exist in this world right now.

This world which sits in a period of time where the the perversity of knowledge and noise is a fundamental aspect of our Internet connected society, yet also a world with a climate changing at such a rapid rate that the dominant species has set in motion its own inevitable extinction.

Our culture is one which is fully aware of its own demise and yet is also powerless to make any changes to that fate due to the massive imbalance of power; the very few with the majority of wealth interested solely in taking more and the rest of life which is losing at an increasingly rapid rate.

Our children our growing up hopeless, an understandable response to being born into a dying world controlled by those who hope their hoards of wealth will save them from the self destructive nature of the system they've lost control of. We see this hopelessness in the memes that they find refuge in, the nihilism that defines their response to the state of life on Earth, in the schools they're shooting up each day, in the drugs they're dying to as they try to escape reality.

I've climbed the ladders of this society, I've worked through the capitalist system, played roles as both the worker and owner, fought for capital and fought for labor. I've tried leaving the capitalist system, rejecting it's existence, denying reality and suffering the consequences and effects this has on the mental health of a human being.

I've found some peace, not all peace, through attempting to move myself into a position of acceptance for the hypernormalised unreality that we exist in, and I continue to practice that acceptance every day.

There will be no solution to the largest problems our species faces, our dominant culture is one of exploitation of our future stability, it will consume until it has destroyed all life.

However that is then and this is now, these existential problems which we face are absurd and depressing, but they cannot consume your mind or else they will take you from your duty to exist.

So like I said, if you need help with technology and business, or if you just want to chat about the meaningless of it all and getting through it, feel free to [get in touch](/contact/ "Contact Me").
