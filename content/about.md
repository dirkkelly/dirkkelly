You're here to learn more about how Dirk Kelly can relate to your journey through existence at this point in time, how can this other character in your movie be of any assistance to you, and also how can they be of risk?

My goal is to provide support to others and himself in the areas of technology, business, and philosophy; and by philosophy nothing more fancy than trying to understand what it is to exist in this world right now. This world which sits in a period of time where the the perversity of knowledge and noise is a fundamental aspect of our Internet connected society yes also one with a climate that is changing at such a rapid rate that the dominant species has set in motion its own extinction, once it's finished with all other life.

Our culture now exists as one which is fully aware of its own demise and yet is also seemingly powerless to make any changes to that fate due to the massive imbalance of power between the very few with the majority of wealth, and the rest of the species which is losing more footing each year.

Our children our growing up hopeless, an understandable response to being born into a dying world controlled by those who hope their hoards of wealth will save them from the self destructive nature of the system they control. We see this hopelessness in the memes that they find refuge in, the nihilism that defines their response to the state of life on Earth.

I've climbed the ladders of this society, I've worked through the capitalist system, played roles as both the worker and owner, fought for capital and fought the labor. I've tried leaving the capitalist system, rejecting it's existence, denying reality and suffering the consequences and effects this has on the mental health of a human being.

I've found some peace, not all peace, through attempting to move myself into a position of acceptance for the hypernormalised unreality that we exist in, and I continue to practice that acceptance every day.

There will be no solution to the largest problems our species faces, our dominant culture is one of exploitation of our future stability in order to survive and it will consume until it has destroyed life.

However that is then and this is now, these existential problems which we face are absurd and depressing, but they cannot consume your mind or else they will take you from your duty to exist.

So like I said, if you need help with technology and business, or if you just want to chat about the meaningless of it all, feel free to [get in touch](/contact/ "Contact Me").
