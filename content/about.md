## Australian

This has come to mean so much to me, I have so much love for a country that supported me into becoming who I am.

I believe in cultural exchange, that we need to be challenged so that we can grow and give back more.

## Socialist

The economic system of our society is one of violent repression and extreme wealth in a tiny percent of people.

We need to take down this economic system and build one which fairly distributes the wealth amongst all people.

## Technologist

I'm building this documentation with a new piece of technology that I'm hoping to implement across my organization.

This gives me an opportunity to compare the tool to so many others that I have used, contributed to, consulted on, deployed with, supported, regretted, and praised.

I adore the Internet, simplifying the ability to publish to it is a high priority to me.

That's not to say I don't recognize and abhor the cost of technology influencing our lives.

## Chief Technology Officer

[InterExchange](https://www.interexchange.org/) is a non profit organization which understands that people build empathy towards each other through in-person interaction.

With the aim of reducing adversity between cultures we administer international exchange programs that enable participants to interact with a foreign society through work and volunteer opportunities.

I'm their Chief Technology Officer. It's my responsibility to understand how the industry can be innovated and made more efficient, then guide the implementation of these improvements through structured process and automation.

## Fort Collins

Summer 2017 I moved to Fort Collins Colorado and it was one of the best decisions of my life. I love being surrounded by huge mountains, good people, and chill vibes.

In only a month here I've made great friends, been on many bike rides (from [Poudre Trail](http://www.poudretrail.org/) [Tour De Fat](https://www.newbelgium.com/events/tour-de-fat)), and seem some great live music.

Working remotely has resulted in huge improvements to my lifestyle, I'm healthier, happier, and more effective here.

## New York

I moved to New York in 2011 to advance my career in software development at [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs).

Consulting was a fantastic way for me to experience the huge variety of organizations in the world, and relate that experience back to my skill of system analysis, design, and development.

I went on to join InterExchange's headquarters are in New York, I work as a full time remote employee.

## Perth

I was born here, I promise you it's one of the most beautiful places I have been on this Earth.

My family live here, they're a clan of caring, hard-working, intelligent, and opinionated people.
