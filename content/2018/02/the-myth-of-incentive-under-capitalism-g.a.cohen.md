You are not wrong, but, let's just replace a few words in what you're saying, and see how things are going in 2018... I almost wrote 2019, because it's almost, 2020, in the fucking future, here's where capitalism's competition, has gotten us.

Yeah that's right, CAPITALISM KILLS it kills not only the workers who are hyper-exploited in developing nations (some of them get caught in the nets when they jump from their slave factory) it kills the chances of our species to behave in such a way that it guarantees and improves the quality of life that comes after it.

In its quest for continuous growth, it consumes everything.

Like a killer robot, that uses nanoclouds to feed on biosphere matter, in order to self replicate and create more of its interconnected killer robots which consume the biosphere.

Or you know, continue to EXPLOIT materials on this Earth that are leading to changes in our BIOSPHERE which will severely impact the way that humans and all other life on Earth... SURVIVE.

Capitalism Kills, I'm not advocating for an "other" I'm just clarifying on the current state of the world that has been HYPER-EXPLOITED due to TECHNOLOGICAL advance and the ever increasing CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH AND POWER.

In order to combat the destructive impact of capitalism, we must turn towards each other, we must work together locally (and internationally) using whatever TECHNOLOGY and DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND POWER we can to take control of the decision making systems of our societies, the government.

This is done, through enforcing power upon systems of control (levers), those systems of control very between communities, so recognize them, hopefully they look like public positions with voting, maybe they're as arcane as requiring a bunch of people to turn up in a room and stand in the corner of the PERSON WHO REALLY WOULD HAVE WON OMG BERNIE and probably get denied of that because they RAN OUT OF SPACE FOR DEMOCRACY HAHAH SERIOUSLY?

[America come on, you're not a democracy, at best you're a flawed democracy, and you're not even the first at that anymore,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_(2017) "America is a Flawed Democracy") literally South Korea just overtook you, and they literally worked with you to democratically overthrow the localized organizing parties, fighting the split of their country by outside forces (America).

But you have been, and you can be a democratic country again, but in order to do that, you need to do something, and I mean you, you need to do something.

Every one of you needs to go out into your community and meet the people around you\*, literally the problem in your country is that CAPITALISM and your CULTURE's literal fucking religious obsession with it and the idea that killing everything is awesome as long as the number goes up, has realized that the best way to pump as much out of you as it can, is to make you scared, make you hate each other, make you buy guns, and go to movies, and spend all your fucking free time arguing on the internet while looking at ads.

CAPITALISM IS KILLING AMERICA and by that I mean that it's killing you, the people, the economy is already fucked, but it is everywhere in the world, the next thing that is fucked is your quality of life, just like it has been, for so many of you, for so long.

Life in America will continue to get worse for the poorer, and while it can and is getting relatively better in the rest of the world, the wealth distribution is not coming equally from america, it is being drained out of the poorest, while the richest hoard their wealth at the expense of their country men.

AMERICA, CAPITALISM IS KILLING YOU.

KILL CAPITALISM.

Do that buy not contributing to their system, do that by engaging in your local community, help those in need, replace times when you would consume (such as going to the mall, which you don't do anymore, so I guess, sitting on your phone arguing about how shit things are) and go out into your community and help those.

Anyway, here's the video.
