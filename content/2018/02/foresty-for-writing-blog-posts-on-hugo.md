I'm just writing a blog post, like I would have done in Wordpress years ago, before I made the decision to move to a statically hosted site for the huge development and security improvements that it brings.

But I stopped posting, I started again recently, but the barrier of entry was always there. Pull up vim and stare at a completely blank piece screen ... and type, or don't, because it's so intimidating.

I think I've found the solution to this problem, and hopefully this super easy to write blog post is the beginning of more, it is my website after all, I should _feel_ like I can contribute to it more, instead of feeling like I'm writing code that I'll need to put through a PR.

Wait but how do I add a picture? Oh, like that.

[Forestry.io](https://forestry.io "Forestry.io"), give it a go if you're running a static website, but looking for a beautiful interface to sit on top of it.

Okay, I just discovered the preview button, this is going to change people's lives.
