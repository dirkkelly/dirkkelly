I'm very grateful for the new things that have come into my life over the last few weeks, today a lot of that came together and resulted in the latest version of my website, built on my latest computer, using the latest artwork created by a fantastic thinker [Rationality Rules](https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules/).

I also added a new category today, [survive](/survive/) which gives me a place to put content that inspires us to drive forward with our efforts to create change in our world.

Survive :)
