That’s why I sunk into depression

That’s why I became so anxious

That’s why I stopped caring about anything 

That’s why I couldn’t stay true

That’s why I couldn’t marry you 

That’s why I left New York

That’s why I made jobs in Perth

That’s why I will go home

That’s where I’ll die, as we all do.
