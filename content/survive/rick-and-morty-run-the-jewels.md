A new collaboration dropped between Rick and Morty & Run The Jewels, Oh Mama wasn't on my radar until this film clip, wonder if I'd ever get my own mother to watch this?

> A country boy chilling in Brooklyn like Lefty spoke for me<br/>
> Fuck with us<br/>
> You fuck with the truth, we speak openly<br/>

> I smoke the holy herb, get high as hell and meditate<br/>
> Swear to God, shit's so good, fat boy'll levitate<br/>
> God gift to man, how the fuck they try to legislate<br/>
> Mom's, she recovering, tell me I over-medicate<br/>
> I tell her, "Holy fuck, Jesus Christ, give me a fucking break"<br/>

> They want us dying, mama<br/>
> My mama said that I'm not living right<br/>
> But I ain't crying, mama<br/>
> My mama said that I'm not living right<br/>
> You raised a lion, mama<br/>
> I ain't lying, mama<br/>
> My mama said that I'm not living right<br/>
> I said, "I'm trying mama"<br/>

I was already on a serious Run The Jewels binge, especially with my week back in New York, smashing those streets and pushing away all the noise needs a good beat, some war drums to keep you moving forward.

> A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses<br/>
> To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit<br/>
> A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits<br/>
> We're still here running 'round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing<br/>

> Got hope for the living, got prayers for the dead<br/>
> In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head<br/>
> Got kush for the pain, the world is dangerous<br/>
> Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust<br/>

> You say you wanna be my leader, I think you wanna be my God<br/>
> You say you on the side of the righteous (right) I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong<br/>
> There's truth where the filth is, there's lies in the law<br/>

Team that up with this favorite I've been hitting up since my holidays back in Perth and you've got enough encouragement to walk through the Devilâ€™s Lair (JP Morgan, Chase, DB, et al) for a week, and to keep-your-fucking-power-dry and head down while you do it.

> Placed where the steel and cement became nature<br/>
> Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous<br/>
> Cityscape where the blood of good men courses<br/>
> And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain<br/>
> Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit<br/>

> Don't fret little man, don't cry<br/>
> They can never take the energy inside you were born with<br/>
> Knowing that, understand you could never be poor<br/>
> You already won the war, you were born rich<br/>
> You can only take the energy you had<br/>
> Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is<br/>
> Whoever, whatever that lord is<br/>
> Couldn't give a fuck if you ever made fortunes<br/>
> Fuck anyone ever tryin' to run that punk shit<br/>
> Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live<br/>
> Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us<br/>
> Don't understand love's importance<br/>
> And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth<br/>
> Where the ashes and dust got formed in<br/>

Thanks for the week New York, I'll be seeing ya. Thanks for helping me survive another week Run The Jewels.
