I'm sorry for being so rude to you, for treating with the disdain with which I actually feel for myself. I'm sorry for going off and turning into someone you really don't recognize anymore, for not giving you the opportunity to learn enough of who I had become through that journey.

Writing would have helped this, it would have helped me communicate to you what I have been working on, what I have learnt, and experimented with, and come to understand about the world that we live in, together. It would have helped me communicate to myself what I was thinking, it would have helped me focus my thoughts and what I needed to do next.

Alas, we'll see if this time I can be a consistent writer.

Regardless this piece is just to say that I will try harder, I will try harder to more effectively communicate with you how I'm feeling, what I'm working on, and where I am focusing on in the future.

I am calm, I am confident, and I am still very concerned for the future of our species.

I know, I went there straight away. I didn't even open up with something relevant to our relationship, some detail about the strains that we have personally been feeling, I went to issue of the extinction of all life on our planet.

I do this so that you know, that ultimately, while I am both calm and collected (for the most part), I am still very focused on this singular issue and more importantly how it came to be our reality, and what we need to do to adapt to the changes that are coming.

It scares you when I call myself anti-capitalist, I think I've even gone so far as to say, if not heavily infer that you and I are personally at odds due to your relationship with capitalism and my opinion of Online Feudalism 2.0™️.

In reality as much as I cosplay the class-war in my daily interactions with you, it's not truly you that I am focused on defeating.

Because ultimately like me, you're nothing.

You are not the real holder of power in this system, you are as equally a victim as me. On a long enough timeline everything returns to zero.

You do have some private capital though, or at least fundamental decision making power over that allocation of capital. What you are doing with that private capital though is, at this point in time, knowing what it is we do, scientifically, about where we are, extremely immoral.

You are a good person, you have a heart that has grown through adversity, you have taken on a world built against you and yet you have still carved our a relatively safe place in this world. I love you, even though I don't show it very well, you must know I really do love you.

I'm not angry, I'm just really disappointed.

You look at my activism, you glance what I try to get into your attention span, but you don't want to look into it, you don't want to learn about it, you don't want to feel uncomfortable with that knowledge.

Not yet anyway, and I still see it as my responsibility to help you get there, and I need to do a better job of it.

For now I'm going to ask that you go check out these websites, question how you can be involved.
