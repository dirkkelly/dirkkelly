I'm sorry for being so rude to you, for treating you like with the disdain which I most feel for myself, for going off and turning into someone you probably don't recognize, and not giving you the opportunity to learn enough of who I had become through that journey.

Writing would have helped this, it would have helped my communicate to you what I have been working on, what I have learnt, and experimented with, and come to understand about the world that we live in, together.

So this piece is just to say that I will try harder, I will try harder to more effectively communicate with you how I'm feeling, what I'm working on, and where I am focusing on in the future.

I am calm, I am confident, and I am still very concerned for the future, of our species.

I know, I went there straight away. I didn't even open up with something relevant to our relationship, some detail about the strains that we have personally been feeling, I went to issue of the extinction of all life on our planet.

I do this so that you know, that ultimately, while I am those things of calm and collected, I am still very focused on this singular issue, and more interestingly, how it came to be our reality, and what we need to do to adapt to the changes that are coming.
