Powerful imagery from [Extinction Rebellion Western Australia](https://www.facebook.com/ausrebellionwa/) at the shameful Fossil Fuel Sponsored Perth Festival.

Our lives are poisoned, not only by the emissions released by fossil fuels, but by the seeping of corporate propaganda into how we perceive reality.

Capitalism shapes the world that we interact with, numbing us to the destruction caused to our planet, our lives, and our relationships with each other by forces focused solely on profit.

We must break down the walls put up between us and stand together against the criminals harming us.
