It's hard to write to you about the loneliness you're going to feel, about the issolation it can cause you, the pain that you will go through.

Explore the counter cultures you find, there are so many artists out there who are raging against a machine that is feeding off our future.

Find allies, they're all around you, they see the cruelty, the oppression, the failure, the cost that failure is causing on all life.
