title: April 2019 NYC to PER What a Ride
desription: Slept 8 hours lying down. Bugged out the Facial Scanners, and the fastest I've been in an A380
---

I can feel my stress levels plumetting, I've been back 5 hours and I feel so much calmer, on the inside.

On the outside I was pretty good, in my behavior I was chill, I just went with the entire ride and I was rewarded with the patience.

Couldn't book tickets for QF12 online (still)

I said hello to the system once, it immediately made it's presense aware to me after the fact.

I'm back from another NYC jaunt and I had the most amazing trip yet,

NYC Scanner from JFK Terminal 8 was a blue model with a typical scanner, laptops kept in, but mine got double scanned with laptot and ipad removed.

Leaving LAX. Everyone in economy? Not sure of other "classes". They had security cameras.

I pulled a face a few times and dropped into a manual check lane, just an agent looking at passports and your face like you would usually have.

- 3 personal jobs

Through the 4 "friendly" facial recognition gates stood the 5 armed agents / police / military? What is it even these days?

+ 2 military jobs

Only one lane open in LAX so delayed 45 minutes.

, plane was going so fast!

Heard on the SYDNEY domestic transfer bus (lol) that they were 100 passengers under in order to make it.

Plane went in to super speed mode

LAX slept over four seats for at least 8 hours
