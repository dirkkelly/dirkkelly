## Human

It took me a long time to accept this limitation in my being. I believe it to be one of the most important and yet most overlooked aspects of who I am.

As a human I am prone to so many flawed traits, to be a great example of this species will take significant effort.

Here I am, attempting to carry out that work by building documentation of who I am.

## Australian

This has come to mean so much to me, I have so much love for a country that supported me into becoming who I am. My culture defines me, and yet I am so interested in how others have been influenced by their cultures.

I believe in cultural exchange, I believe that we need to be challenged in our values by those who have lived with different external influences.

## Socialist

Am I? I don't know anymore. I'm certainly not a fan of our current economic model. That's not to say that I don't recognize how to leverage it. I just chose for so long to disregard and fight against a system I didn't believe in.

Ultimately I benefit from, and contribute to, and extemely capitalize system at this point.

A goal is to move beyond capitalism towards a system that doesn't require labor to define value of humans, yet recognizes that those same humans require purpose in order to survive.

## Technologist

I'm building this documentation with a new piece of technology that I'm hoping to implement across my organization.

This gives me an opportunity to compare the tool to so many others that I have used, contribuated to, consulted on, deployed with, supported, regretted, and praised.

I adore the Internet, simplifying the abiliy to publish to it is a high priority to me.

That's not to say I don't recognize, abore, and warn against the cost of technology influencing our lives.

## Executive

[InterExchange](https://www.interexchange.org/) is a non profit organizatin which understands that people build empathy towards each other through in-person interaction.

With the aim of reducing adversity between cultures we administer international exchange programs that enable participants to interact with a foreign society through work and volunteer opportunities.

I'm their Chief Technology Officer. It's my responsibility to understand how the industry can be innovated and made more effiency, then guide the implementation of these improvements through structured process and automation.

## Perth

I was born here, I promise you it's one of the most beautiful places I have been on this Earth.

My family live here, they're a clan of caring, hard-working, intelligent, and opionated people.

Perth's economy is weak, I recognized this many years ago and moved in response.

I hope to help this beautiful city of industrious people move into a new economic model that works for all of them.

## New York

I moved here over 5 years ago to advance my career in software development at [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs).

Consulting was a fantastic way for me to experience the huge variety of organizations in the world, and relate that experience back to my skill of system analysis, design, and development.

After a few years working in consulting I moved to InterExchannge. New York is where our headquarters are located, as such I'm very often located there myself.

I enjoy New York, I don't love it, but I love the friends that have become my family here.

## Fort Collins

Colorado stole my heart the first time I visited. It's funny that a small town like Fort Collins has become such an important part of my life.

It's a beautiful city, located in the most beautiful area of the country.

If I could live here, I would. Maybe some day I will.
