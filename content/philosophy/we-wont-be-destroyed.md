Under the oppression of tyranny we learn helplessness.

Under constant division we stand alone.

Under threat of violence we do not fight for freedom.

Together we can get our fair share.

Together we can serve our purpose.

Together we can change the future.

#### **Stand Together & Together We Stand.**
