This society which praises capitalism for its efficiency in driving progress, justifies the necessary destruction of life under the claim that it is doing so with the permission of both the people and God. These justifications are pathetic at best, they're also lies, the dominant culture is driven by neither Democratic or Christian values which it pays so much lip service to.

Democracy and Christianity are frameworks for creating equality amongst all people, in theory. In practice the dominant forms of Democracy and Christianity have been co-opted by the powerful to serve as tools that concentrate wealth and power and punish everyone else.
