Under the oppression of tyranny we learn helplessness.

Under the constant division we stand alone.

Under the fear of violence we do not fight for freedom.

Together we can get our fair share.

Together we can serve our purpose.

Together we can change the future.

#### **Stand Together & Together We Stand.**
