Under the oppression of tyranny we learn helplessness.

Under constant division we stand alone.

Under the threat of violence we do not fight for freedom.

Together we can challenge unjust authority.

Together we can receive our fair value.

Together we can serve our mission.

Together we are able to shape our future in our vision.

#### **Stand Together, so together we stand**
