> There is no experience you have a had that you are not at the absolute center of the world that you experience is in front of you. 

> Other people's thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you, but yours are right there.

> That loneliness is not a function of solitude

> That sometimes human beings have to just sit in one place and, like, hurt

> That there is such a thing as raw, unalloyed, agenda-less kindness

> That if you do something nice for somebody in secret, anonymously, without letting the person you did it for know it was you or anybody else know what it was you did or in any way or form trying to get credit for it, it's almost its own form of intoxicating buzz. 

> That it is permissible to want

> That there might not be angels, but there are people who might as well be angels.

David Foster Wallace
