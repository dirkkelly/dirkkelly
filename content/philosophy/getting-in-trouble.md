I hadn't been using my blog because I was afraid to, afraid of what would happen if I wrote about what I was thinking, like I used to write about on this thing. When I was 20 it was tattoos and money for getting tattoos that meant enough to me to end up written down.

These days I write about the atrocities committed locally and globally by the American Empire, a system so corrupted by power that its current course is set on destroying all life as we know it.

I could get in trouble for this. Technically of course I shouldn't, technically this is a free society, but as I sit here at my laptop in my studio apartment, I can't help but feel a kindred spirit towards Winston Smith, in his corner, writing in his diary.

Well my diary is public, on a constant chain of commits which get published to the world and sent through all sorts of signal processing systems, big brother has been watching for decades, the differences is that now we all know, and we're terrified by it.

But what's the worst that could happen to me? Well a lot of things really, as the US government no longer seems to follow any human rights laws and has completely undermined my rights to a trial as a non-citizen, a lot of horrible things could happen to me.

But I've had a really good life, even if I have gotten in trouble a lot. I've never lived a life of a citizen in a country like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, or Pakistan. I'll never have to go through the torture of raising two children who are scared of the blue skies because they know that's when the Americans send the drones, to drop bombs on them, to save them from terror, to bring them democracy, to give them freedom.

So I'm going to keep speaking up, I'm going to keep telling people that the only way this changes is if they get engaged in their community, is if they press on their government to change. People need to get out into the streets, as they're doing more and more, they need to demand change, they need to walk out of their jobs, they need to block the streets of Washington... which reminds me of Mario Savio's famous words.

> There comes a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!<br/>

You have a choice, as a member of this species, whether you're a citizen of America or one of its ally countries, you have a choice about how you respond to this power. You can continue to consume daily, distracting yourself from the pain and suffering this system fills you with, or you can speak up.

You don't have to speak up in a public sphere, you can keep your comments local and raise your concerns about an unjust society to people in your community, help others who are helping people in your local world to make things better around you.

If you're feeling up to it, you can talk to your local members of power, business owners, mayors, counselors, even governors.

Most importantly you can interact with your local government, engage in voting, take time to understand candidates and share that information with your friends, help others understand the issues and work for change.

But you have to speak up, you have to say that enough is enough, this machine which the American people are no longer in control of is threatening the futures of their children, and children in other countries. The American Empire needs to be stopped, it needs to become the American People's Government, before it kills all people.

Speak up, speak truth to power.
