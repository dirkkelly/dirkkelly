For me the biggest relief I’ve learnt over these years is that I’m not solely responsible for saving our species from extinction. 

The hardest thing to come to terms with is that most of the species is ignorant of the dangers we face, or responsible in their own small way for pushing us closer to the edge. 

Alone you cannot save us from the impact climate change will have on our ability to produce enough food for our survival. 

Alone you cannot save us from the devastation which would be caused by nuclear, nor can you stop us from firing them, or convince those in power to dismantle them. 

Alone you cannot convince our society to abandon the quest for unlimited financial gains at the expense of life, to create a society which values all life and is an environment which fosters new life. 

Alone you cannot change your workplace so that everyone has access to vital information about the company in order to have informed input into how it operates. 

We can do these things together though. 

We can do these things by approaching all problems head on, by not only accepting they are real issues, but by voicing our expectations for solving them. 

The increidble thing is just how close to the mechanisms for change we all are, in fact we interact with them each day that we go to work. 

If “we the people” all have an equal opportunity to participate in directing the missions of our organizations we can solve climate change, we can proliferate nuclear disarmament, we can get our fair share of the value we produce, and we can pull ourselves and everyone around us out of the poverty we are being forced into. 

If the collection of humanity  hasn’t control of their organization they can press on goverments to behave in a way that improves the quality of life for everyone. 

Right now companies are owned by a very small percentage of people, these people get increasingly more wealthy as they horde the majority of value earnt by a company, they use this wealth to push governments to behave in a way that only benefits them, and people like them, at the expense of everyone else. 

Climate change is the result of corporations ignoring science in order to earn more money. 

War is the result of corporations using the military to progress their economic interests abroad. 

Mass inneqality is the result of companies funelling the value ordiuced by everyone’s in the company up to a very few individuals, a the expense of all the other workers. 

Unite with your colleagues to take control of your organization, unite with your neighbors to point the power of your organizations at solving the problems we all face. 

We can save the world, if we work together to focus on the problems facing us.
