# **10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth and Power**

Concentration of wealth yields concentration of power, particularly so as the cost of elections skyrockets, which forces the political parties into the pockets of major corporations. This political power quickly translates into legislation that increases the concentration of wealth, so fiscal policy like tax policy, deregulation, rules of corporate governance, and a whole variety of measures. Political measures designed to increase the concentration of wealth and power which in turn yields more political power to do the same thing, and that's what we've been seeing.

## So we have this kind of vicious cycle in progress.

It is so traditional that it was described by Adam Smith, in 1776, you read the famous Wealth of Nations, he says in England the principle architects of policy are the people who own the society, in his day merchants and manufacturers, and they make sure that their own interests are very well cared for however grievous the impact on the people of England or others.

Now it's not merchants and manufacturers, it's financial institutions and multinational corporations. The people who Adam Smith called the **Masters of Mankind** and they're following the vile maxim **All for ourselves and nothing for anyone else.**
