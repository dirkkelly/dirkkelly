Zero Book's "The Left's War on Christmas" does a great job of helping Marxists understand the value of the story of Santa. If we are to succeed in helping others imagine a different world and subsequently helping to create that as a reality, we must allow them to dream of alternatives to capitalism.

Maybe a dude giving out presents to everyone in the world isn't the worst thing to encourage.

NonCompete's "Was Jesus a Communist" explains that the political thought of communism as well as capitalism didn't exist 2000 odd years ago, however that we we can relate his words to the two systems. 

Jesus spoke of a community which helped all, this was bastardized by Constantine who merged Christianity with the state to turn it into another force for class warfare.

All of these resources remind us that this is a time for sharing with others, and that real joy comes from doing and working for good, as Kropotkin says

> Struggle so that all may live this rich, overflowing life. And be sure that in this struggle you will find a joy greater than anything else can give.
