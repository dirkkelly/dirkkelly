## The Future Can't Be Known

The future isn’t something for us to know, to make predictions of what it holds for us is a game I'm trying to avoid playing, [as fun as it can be](/collapse/america-will-collapse-earth-will-boil-humanity-will-perish/). However the past and present is something we can measure, and those measurements can give us guidance for what could possibly happen in the future.

The empire celebrates the measurements of football scores, stock prices, and unemployment rates. The narrative we hear is that we’re in a global financial recovery, that there are less unemployed Americans than ever, things are going well for everyone and if they’re not for you, then you must be doing something wrong.

In reality that is barely half the truth, those narratives do not accurately reflect life in America, those measurements were chosen by the few who benefit from the continuation of the status quo, and the resulting work those living under it produce.

A measurement you won’t hear from Empire's sources is that since 2008 the real wage of Americans, that is their wage relative to the items they buy, has not changed.

Those who’s insurance and savings have run out have finally been forced to go back into the workforce. Yes sure they’re employed, but where they were once a manager at a local firm they’re now an Uber driver, where they once had full time employment and health insurance, they have casual work and pay more for car insurance.

A society which won’t recognize the problems it’s facing will certainly not take any actions to improve the lives of those suffering under it. I’m not here to predict where the lives of Americans are headed, what I’m here to do is tell you what I’m planning to do with my life, as an Australian who lived here from 2011 until 2018.

## Preparing to Live With Less

I recognize that this lack of recovery is an inherent part of the economic system Americans, Australians, and most of the world live under. This system is designed such that any excess value created is distributed to those who own shares of corporations. In America 10% of the population own 78% of the shares, these 10% receive more and more wealth every year. This wealth is generated through selling goods and services for more than they cost to produce and it's the other 90% of the population doing the producing.

This system is known as capitalism, and since its formation over 200 years ago it has on average suffered from a crash every 4-7 years. These crashes are caused when confidence in the health of the economy fails, people stop buying and a reset it required to...
