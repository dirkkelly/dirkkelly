## The Future Can't Be Known

The future isn’t something for us to know, to make predictions of what it holds for us is a game I'm trying to avoid playing, [as fun as it can be](/collapse/america-will-collapse-earth-will-boil-humanity-will-perish/).

However the past and present is something we can measure, and those measurements can give us guidance for what could possibly happen in the future.

The empire celebrates the measurements of football scores, stock prices, and unemployment rates. The narrative we hear is that we’re in a global financial recovery, that there are less unemployed Americans than ever, things are going well for everyone and if they’re not for you, then you must be doing something wrong.

In reality that is barely half the truth, those narratives do not accurately reflect life in America, those measurements were chosen by the few who benefit from the continuation of the status quo, and the resulting work those living under it produce.

A measurement you won’t hear from Empire's sources is that since 2008 the real wage of Americans, that is their wage relative to the items they buy, has not changed.

Those who’s insurance and savings have run out have finally been forced to go back into the workforce. Yes sure they’re employed, but where they were once a manager at a local firm they’re now an Uber driver, where they once had full time employment and health insurance, they have casual work and pay more for car insurance.

A society which won’t recognize the problems it’s facing will certainly not take any actions to improve the lives of those suffering under it. I’m not here to predict where the lives of Americans are headed, what I’m here to do is tell you what I’m planning to do with my life, as an Australian who lived here from 2011 until 2018.

## Living Together With Less

This lack of recovery is an inherent part of the economic system Americans, Australians, and most of the world live under. This system is designed such that any excess value created is distributed to those who own shares of corporations. In America 10% of the population own 78% of those shares, these people receive more and more wealth every year. This wealth is generated through selling goods and services for more than they cost to produce, and it's the other 90% of the population doing the producing. 

This system is known as capitalism, and since its formation over 200 years ago it has on average suffered from a crash every 4-7 years. This economic system pits members of its society against each other, but not in a way of the haves verse the have nots, but in the haves vs the haves, and the have nots vs the have nots. Those who own the corporations fight each other to reduce their costs, and those who work for the corporations fight each other for those very salaries which cost the corporations. As we prepare to live in a future where 90% of the population increasingly have less, is this the model we want to base our lives in? 

Solidarity is the concept of uniting with your fellow people to achieve a common goal which benefits everyone in the society. This concept runs counter to an individualistic society where everyone is working to keep themselves alive at the expense of others, and this concept is vital for a society with increasingly less and less to survive. Through solidarity we build community, and through community we have a support network which takes care of everyone, including those who cannot work such as children and the elderly.

## As Climate Collapses, So Will The Economy

It's important to note another very significant reality of our lives, that not only is our economy not recovering, the environment which the economy depends on is declining. Climate change continues to be a barely debated issue in the empire, although 98% of scientists recognize it exists and recognize we are underestimating its impact, the business owners spend their wealth sowing doubt in society to ensure their profits aren't hurt, while the world around them changes so rapidly that their profits are ultimately hurt as the world fails to produce enough to keep the system going.

This globalized capitalist economy relies on vast amounts of energy to power distribution chains that allow them to exploit the poorest of the world in their drive to keep costs low and profits high. The food we eat every day is delivered to us through fast networks powered by the fossil fuels which produce the atmosphere polluting carbons which fill our atmosphere and trap the heat. This increasing in heat causes our seasons to shift, increasing the length of our summers and decreasing the length of our winters. 

The impact of this is so widespread that it can't be covered in any single discussion, but there are some big ticket items, we know that our ice caps are melting at an increasing rate, this raises sea levels and sea temperatures. Raised sea levels reduces the amount of land which humans can use to produce food, raised sea temperatures kill off the lowest levels of sea food chains, resulting in ever decreasing life in the ocean. Every year warmer oceans trap less carbon dioxide than the year before, this results in further increases of temperature, these increased temperatures start to affect more ecosystems, breeding cycles of animals become increasingly disrupted, large animals fail to reproduce in this hotter climate, as micro animals which carry diseases thrive in the longer more humid summers.

This feedback loop of climate change cannot be reversed, and while the wealthy elite will promise salvation through technology, this is only in a bid to gain more wealth through large scale for profit projects funded by the community which increase their wealth. The hope sold to us of a solution to our changing climate is a lie which distracts us from the reality that we will have to live with less in a world which is hostile to our very survival.

## Investing in Our Future

I haven't painted a positive picture of the probably direction of our future, I've stated that not only will the majority of us become increasingly poorer, I've stated this will happen in a world which will become increasingly more difficult and hostile to our very survival. This is the reality I believe we're headed towards and with that background I can now give you an outline of how I am planning to live through the next 20 to 30 years I expect to be alive.
