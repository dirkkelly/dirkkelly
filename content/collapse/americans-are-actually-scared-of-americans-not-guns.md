**As an American**

You lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, what it will bring, what it will change, what it will kill. It's not a question of whether these things will happen, you know they will, something always happens, and it's going to be in your face, and it's going to make you feel horrible.

**Teenager guns down his classmates because of violet video games**

**Cop shoots a child because black teenagers are out of control**

**The US government bombed a wedding because the groom hated freedom**

**Your stupid dickhead of a president opened his dumb fucking mouth again**

So you want to give the police more power because the lower class are out of control and want to destroy this country.

So you don't care if the American war machine keeps bombing innocent families in other countries, because they're not like you, they don't value freedom.

So you realize your president is a a dickhead and you get really angry at him, and you tell all your friends how terrible he is, and you really are upset about what he tweeted.

You do what they want you to do, you see the problem on a surface level and you accept the solution they hand you.

**As an Australian**

I lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, what it will bring, what it will change, what it will kill. It's not a question of whether these things will happen, I know they will, something always happens, and it's going to be in my face, and it's going to make me feel horrible.

**Scared and uneducated American boy kills his classmates and himself**

**Scared and exploited American cop kills a poor and exploited black child**

**America kills more innocent civilians, and points their finger at another country**

**Fuck you Trump, also fuck all your presidents, god damn this nation's leaders are horrible**

So I want Americans to fix their education and health systems so that people aren't sick and poor, so that Americans can imagine a future worth living for.

So I want American police to be disarmed, to have their recycling programs with the US military to be disbanded, to get tanks off the streets of America.

So I want America to stop the wars, to bring its troops home, to stop killing its people back home by destroying social services to fund unlimited war against the world.

So I want American presidents to stop killing life over the world and in your country, yeah I am including Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Reagan in that.

**As a critical thinker**

I realize that the gun problem in America is the tip of the iceberg, that these deaths are caused by shitty people living horrible lives who hate each other and themselves, who kill with guns as often as they kill with opiates.

I realize that the gun problem is more of a problem when the guns are in the hands of police and soldiers who use the to kill innocent people daily, and suffer no consequences.

I realize that America kills as many people abroad as it does at home, I realize that the empire is a machine which can only kill.

I realize that no President has ever been a leader of this country, I see that it has always been the wealth elite who rule from behind the stage, who use their wealth to influence power.

**We need to think more as critical thinkers, and less as scared subjects of empire.**
