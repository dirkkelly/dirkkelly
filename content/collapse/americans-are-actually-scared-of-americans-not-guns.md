**As an American**

You lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, what it will bring, what it will change, what it will kill. It's not a question of whether these things will happen, you know they will, something always happens, and it's going to be in your face, and it's going to make you feel horrible.

* Teenager guns down his classmates because of violet video games
* Cop shoots a child because black teenagers are out of control
* The US government bombed a wedding because the groom hated freedom
* Your stupid dickhead of a president opened his dumb fucking mouth again

So you want to ban all guns because horrible people do fucked up things that result in the death of people who look like you.

So you want to give the police more power because the lower class are out of control and want to destroy this country.

So you don't care if the American war machine keeps bombing innocent families in other countries, because they're not like you, they don't value freedom.

So you realize your president is a dickhead and you get really angry at him, and you tell all your friends how terrible he is, and you get really upset about what he tweeted.

_You do what they want you to do, you see the problem on a surface level and you accept the solution they hand you._

**As an Australian**

I lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, what it will bring, what it will change, what it will kill. It's not a question of whether these things will happen, I know they will, something always happens, and it's going to be in my face, and it's going to make me feel horrible.

* Scared and uneducated American boy kills his classmates and himself
* Scared and exploited American cop kills a poor and exploited black child
* America kills more innocent civilians, and points their finger at another country
* Fuck you Trump, fuck all your presidents, god damn this nation's leaders are horrible

So I want Americans to fix their education and health systems so that people aren't sick and poor, so that Americans can imagine a future worth living for.

So I want American police to be disarmed, to disbanded their recycling programs with the US military, to get tanks off the streets of America and everywhere else.

So I want America to stop the wars, to bring its troops home, to stop killing its people back home by destroying social services to fund unlimited war against the world.

So I want American presidents to stop killing life over the world and in your country, yeah I am including Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Reagan in that.

_I react to your weird ways in a manner which places the blame solely on your country and your politics._

**As a critical thinker**

I realize that the gun problem in America is the tip of the iceberg, that these deaths are caused by people living horrible lives who are scared into hating each other and themselves, who kill with guns as much as they kill with opiates.

I realize that the gun problem is more of a problem when the guns are in the hands of police and soldiers who use them to kill innocent people daily, and suffer no consequences.

I realize that America kills as many people abroad as it does at home, I realize that the Empire is a machine which can only kill, I also realize that Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand are willing participants in Empire's war against the world.

I realize that no President has ever been the true leader of this country, I see that it has always been the wealthy elite who rule from behind the stage, who use their wealth to influence power.

_I know that the left and right fighting against each other is part of a greater strategy of distracting the American people from turning against their enemy government, from taking down an Empire from within that will kill all life on Earth._

**We need to respond more as critical thinkers and react less as scared subjects, nationality aside, we are in this together, this fight against Empire.**
