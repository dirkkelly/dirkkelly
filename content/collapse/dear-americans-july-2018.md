You haven't heard from me in a while, I haven't written for a few months and I tend to go quiet when I'm in another time zone, so I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have I been? I'm going really well, having finally moved back to Australia I'm enjoying spending my time with family and friends, settling into a much more stable existence than I've experienced over the past 7 years. I'm finally investing in my future again, saving money, planning a home construction project, optimizing my new work and volunteer roles, and going to the gym 3 times a week.

How are things going for you? Since getting back I've been fielding that question for you from intrigued Australians watching your country with confusion.

I explain that [you're living in a collapsing society](http://fortune.com/2015/07/20/united-states-decline-statistics-economic/) which not only spends millions [dropping 121 bombs a day](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/trumps-military-drops-a-bomb-every-12-minutes-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/) to kill the poorest around the world it spends nothing on the poorest at home who suffer to contaminated water [in 42 states](https://www.thoughtco.com/chemical-contaminated-tap-water-in-us-1204205) and [400 military bases](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/04/25/nearly-400-military-bases-must-be-tested-water-contamination.html) and can't afford a [$400 medical bill](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html).

How is this possible they ask. "How can Americans let their country be blatantly destroyed?" I explain it's because their government is corrupt.

Then when they ask "how can some American's believe that Trump is going to save them?" I explain it's because they're absolutely desperate. They're so aware of the corruption of their government that the masses of both sides of the political spectrum have thrown aside the false leaders that are available, creating a power vacuum for a new form of leadership, fascism.

This is not nazism, this is not Hitlerism, or any existing form of fascism; this is American Fascism, this is Trumpism.
