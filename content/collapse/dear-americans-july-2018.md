You haven't heard from me in a while, I haven't written for a few months and I tend to go quiet when I'm in another time zone, so I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have I been? I'm going really well, having finally moved back to Australia I'm enjoying spending my time with family and friends, settling into a much more stable existence than I've experienced over the past 7 years. I'm finally investing in my future again, saving money, planning a home construction project, optimizing my new work and volunteer roles, and going to the gym 3 times a week.

How are things going for you? Since getting back I've been fielding so many questions from intrigued Australians watching your country with confusion and horror. While the media only really speaks of your president's actions, those alone being enough to cause despair, it doesn't tell us how things are going for you. Sometimes their Internet is able to fill the vacuum of this information void, it's such a polarizing medium though, bubbling to the top the us vs them show which defines your politics. 

That's where people like me fit in, those who have lived on the ground and can provide a broader perspective of what's happening to answer the question of how things are going for you. To compensate for the fact that I'm not in America I have to work hard to follow Internet media of Americans who are critically analyzing the lives of people within America.
