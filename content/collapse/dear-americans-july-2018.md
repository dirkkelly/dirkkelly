You haven't heard from me in a while, I haven't written for a few months and I tend to go quiet when I'm in another time zone, so I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have I been? I'm going really well, having finally moved back to Australia I'm enjoying spending my time with family and friends, settling into a much more stable existence than I've experienced over the past 7 years. I'm finally investing in my future again, saving money, planning a home construction project, optimizing my new work and volunteer roles, and going to the gym 3 times a week.

How are things going for you? Since getting back I've been fielding so many questions from intrigued Australians watching your country with confusion and horror. While the media only really speaks of your president's actions, those alone being enough to cause despair, it doesn't tell us how things are going for you. Sometimes their Internet is able to fill the vacuum of this information void, it's such a polarizing medium though, bubbling to the top the us vs them show which defines your politics.

That's where I can provide provide a broader perspective of what's happening to answer the question of how things are going for you. 

I am able to explain that [you're living in a collapsing society](http://fortune.com/2015/07/20/united-states-decline-statistics-economic/) through citing facts about how [40% of American's are unable to afford a $400 bill](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html),  [that your military drop 121 bombs a day](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/trumps-military-drops-a-bomb-every-12-minutes-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/), fail to provide clean drinking water for [citizens in 42 states](https://www.thoughtco.com/chemical-contaminated-tap-water-in-us-1204205) and [soldiers across 400 military bases](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/04/25/nearly-400-military-bases-must-be-tested-water-contamination.html).

How is this possible they ask? How can Americans let their country be destroyed so blatantly. I explain it's not because Americans are monsters, it's because their government is absolutely corrupted.

And when they ask, how can American's believe that Trump is going to save them? I explain it's because they're absolutely desperate, so aware of the corruption of their government that the masses of both sides of the political spectrum have thrown aside the false leaders that are available, creating a power vacuum for a new form of leadership, fascism. This is not nazism, this is not Hitlerism, or any existing form of fascism, this is American Fascism, this is Trumpism.
