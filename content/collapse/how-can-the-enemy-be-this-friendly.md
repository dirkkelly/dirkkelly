subtitle: The American people are our brothers and sisters, The American Government
  is the enemy to life on Earth. We have to love the people, the people have to reclaim

I feel so much love in this place, living a part of this community in Colorado I am surrounded by amazing people who are doing all they can to make the world better.

But any time I start reading up on the latest happenings in "the world" I am bombarded with just how horrible, cruel, and desperate the US government has become.

Today we had Ann Coulter come at Trump hard for signing the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending package, so now everyone wants this Dickhead out?

We wouldn't have been this lucky if Clinton had won, I stand by my position that I'm very glad she lost, even if it meant that President Dickhead had to come in and piss on everything for a bit.

The American people are awakening, they see now more than ever that their government does not answer to them, it answers to the oligarchs that decide how the money is spent.

> **_Sidenote_** _There are great things in this omnibus spending package, I'm very happy it was passed for numerous reasons, and obviously there's probably a tonne of bullshit also. Who cares? We had no say in it anyway really, and that's the problem._

What I'm more happy about is that Republicans are seeing more and more that this Dickhead can do nothing to make their lives better.

What I want more of is Democrats seeing that their pathetic leadership are primarily also puppets for the same oligarchs, I want them to throw away their false Idols in the likes of Clinton, Obama, and Clinton.

I want all Americans to realize that real progress will only come from representatives that actually represent their lives, and predominantly the American life is one of misery and servitude, with the pain covered up with sex, drugs, and of course rock & roll.

As the American people continue to lose their rights, wealth, and dignity they must turn towards their communities, create progress at a local level, and use coordination at these foundational levels to change the power structures that dominate them.

Never ignore real power, creating a farm and "not engaging in bullshit politics" won't change the reality you live in, and should your little project get successful/controversial enough the state will use their power to snub you out, and make the public cheer for your death.
