Universities in America now spend millions every year ensuring that there is diversity of identity on campus, this is for the obvious and common sense reason of ensuring diversity of thought.

Concentration of Power in these diversity centres is now causing laws to be blatantly ignored by stripping away human rights, from right to trial, innocence until proven guilty, free speach in order to drive out discourse and silence questioning of status quo.

The most liberal of institutions has been co-opted into a system of oppression as it extracts wealth from its students and creates an environment which does not prepare them to understamnd the violent world of concentrated wealth and power they are entering in the workforce.
