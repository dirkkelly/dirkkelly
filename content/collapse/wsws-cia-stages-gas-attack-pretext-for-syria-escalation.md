The American empire is pushing forward in its latest unrelenting war on the world, on both the left and right the media is calling for war based on unbelievable claims of chemical war attacks that are all too similar to weapons of mass destruction.

[World Socialist Web Site has covered today in a deep diving article that calls out the latest CIA staged attack, and warns that it will be used to justify an invasion.](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/04/09/pers-a09.html "CIA stages gas attack pretext for Syria escalation")

> The Syrian government claims that one of its airbases, in Homs province,  has already come under missile attack. While the Pentagon is denying  that it has launched any strikes on Syria yet, the rhetoric of the Trump  administration indicates that preparations are being made for  stepped-up military operations.

Meanwhile the majority of media is calling for war on yet another unproven attack.
