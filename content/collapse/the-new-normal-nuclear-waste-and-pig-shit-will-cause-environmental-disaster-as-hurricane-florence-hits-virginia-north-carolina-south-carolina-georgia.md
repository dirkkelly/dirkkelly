  description: In North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia, millions of
    residents are bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which meteorologists
    are warning could unleash life-threatening storm surges and historic flooding
    across a wide swath of the East Coast. Even if the storm weakens, experts warn
    Hurricane Florence could kill thousands of farm animals and trigger catastrophic
    waste spills from sewage treatment plants, hog waste lagoons and chicken farms.
    Many of the factory hog farms in North Carolina store their waste by spraying
    it on nearby fields and neighborhoods, or by depositing it in lagoons that can
    overflow during hurricanes, causing the toxic pig manure to pour into nearby waterways.
    We speak with Naeema Muhammad, organizing co-director for the North Carolina Environmental
    Justice Network, and Will Hendrick, staff attorney with the Waterkeeper Alliance.
