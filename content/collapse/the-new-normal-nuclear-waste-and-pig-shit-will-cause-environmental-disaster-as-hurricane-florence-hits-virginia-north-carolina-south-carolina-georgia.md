  description: In North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia, millions of
    residents are bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which meteorologists
    are warning could unleash life-threatening storm surges and historic flooding
    across a wide swath of the East Coast. Even if the storm weakens, experts warn
    Hurricane Florence could kill thousands of farm animals and trigger catastrophic
    waste spills from sewage treatment plants, hog waste lagoons and chicken farms.
    Many of the factory hog farms in North Carolina store their waste by spraying
    it on nearby fields and neighborhoods, or by depositing it in lagoons that can
    overflow during hurricanes, causing the toxic pig manure to pour into nearby waterways.
    We speak with Naeema Muhammad, organizing co-director for the North Carolina Environmental
    Justice Network, and Will Hendrick, staff attorney with the Waterkeeper Alliance.

Trump is of course being the piece of shit that he is and ignoring the incoming devastation as he defends his pathetic response to Puerto Rico a year ago. But it doesn't matter, the people are going to suffer no matter who's on television.

Amy Goodman starts crying as she speaks to the highest levels of imprisonment of children in US history. Followed by Eric Trump being blatantly anti-semetic on cable news.

This is the new normal, this is what our disgusting unthinking culture has brought us.

We're going to compound that now with the release of pig shit and nuclear waste as 1 billion dollars of pork farming and 9 nuclear reactors are about to get smashed by Hurricane Florence.

This culture, this economic system, this selfishness will oversee the absolute devastation of the East, South, and West coasts of America as the entire countries infrastructure falls to the forces of global climate change.

Oh in good news financially! The US just became the worlds top oil exporter, so that's good I guess
