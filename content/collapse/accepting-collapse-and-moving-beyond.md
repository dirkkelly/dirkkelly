I have to admit that I haven’t been fully honest, in a lot of my writing I’ve implied that it’s important to get engaged in our community in order to change the outcome for our species. 

The truth is that we cannot change the outcome for our species, the time for action has come and gone, people still alive today made decisions 40 years ago to drive our culture down the path of ignoring the problem, the symptoms are starting to show, but the damage is now irreversible. 

The truth also is that you should still focus on community and doing what you can take make the lives of those around you better and you should be taking control of your employing organization and creating a democratic workplace.

Nothing you do will stop the Earth from altering so much so that it’s no longer habitable by us, but what you can do is help towards making the suffering of those around you a little less. 

We weren’t all a profiting part of dominant culture, but we were all exploited by it in some form or another, and at the end of the day we’re all in the collapse of our civilization together. 

Our society based on mass consumption, mass distraction, and mass murder will not be able to sustain us through its collapse, both our physical and mental needs. 

It is imperative that we take on the responsibilities of these needs. The physical responsibilities are maintaining our health and producing our own food. The mental are coming to acceptance with collapse and learning to engage with your human spirit to have offer a repsonse of loving kindness as our world and hopes die.

Our dominant culture has killed us, reject its principles and turn to love, surround yourself and influence others of this imrotance so you can spend the last days of our specifies in loving kindness.
