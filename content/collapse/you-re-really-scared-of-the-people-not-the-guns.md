  and some of you are willing to kill over that.

You lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, what it will bring, what it will change, what it will kill. It's not a question of whether these things will happen, you know they will, something always happens, and it's going to be in your face, and it's going to make you feel horrible.

* Teenager guns down his classmates because of violet video games
* Cop shoots a teenager because black kids are out of control
* The US government bombed a wedding because the groom hated freedom
* Your stupid dickhead of a president opened his dumb fucking mouth again

You want to ban all guns because shitty horrible people do terrible fucked up things that result in the death of people who aren't too dissimilar to you.

You want to give the police more power because the lower class are out of control and want to destroy this amazing country.

You don't care if the American war machine to keeps bombing innocent families in other countries, because they're not like you they don't value freedom.

**You're wrong... oh wait, no, your president is fucking dickhead, but so was Obama :\\**

Your country is responsible for an estimated 10-20 million deaths since 1945, after it dropped two nuclear bombs on an island nation... after the war was over.
