Sitting at work today and I hear the team in the other room talking about passwords.

It's all the things we've heard before, it's people confused about what is a good idea,
what's a terrible idea, and what's a reasonable level of security.

This is a mixed bag discussion and I'm always willing to discuss these points,
please let me know your thoughts below.

> Following on from our discussion today, here's a run down of the password policy. I'm including Alex and Nicole because we're going to be publishing these tips soon.
>
> Only have two InterExchange Passwords
>
>  * Gmail and your computer
>  * Every other website you use
>
> Memorable sentences, with simple character substitution
>
>  * The Penguin Eats Icecream on The Boardwalk =>
>  * ThePengu1nEats1cecreamOnTheBoardwalk =>
>  * ThePenu!nEats1creamOnTheBoardwalk
>
> If you must, write the password down somewhere physically removed from your office.
  Your wallet is an alright choice, just remember if your wallet gets stolen you also need
  to do a password refresh when you're calling your credit card company.
>
> It's even better if you can just remember it and literally destroy it once you have.
  Literally (preferably with fire).
>
> Never reuse your InterExchange password for personal things, not ever.
> This creates an alternative attack route others and just increases the complexity of refreshing things if something goes wrong.
>
> Never give your password to anyone, ever under any circumstances,
> you're literally saying "Hey feel free to do whatever you want and I'll take the fall for it"
> even if they're a nice person, their problems become your problem.
>
> Never give your password to anyone (I know I'm repeating myself),
> if a service ever asks for your password over the phone, or even worse emails you a copy of your password*,
> treat them as a bad website, use a unique password for them, and change that old password everywhere.
>
> Never give your password to anyone (I'm really serious), if you feel you have to, call me in,
> I'll talk you through it, there will be a solution other than giving your password to someone.
>
> On bad websites (like the one above), don't even give them a real password,
> my favorite thing to do here is to create a string of random words that I don't try to remember.
> The next time I go there it is impossible to remember what the password is (because I don't trust them with passwords), so I just do a password reset.
>
> Your inbox is you, if this is compromised, everything is compromised.
> You can see where your account is signed in from the Google account device security page.
>
> Refresh your passwords any time you have a gut feeling that maybe your password has been compromised.
