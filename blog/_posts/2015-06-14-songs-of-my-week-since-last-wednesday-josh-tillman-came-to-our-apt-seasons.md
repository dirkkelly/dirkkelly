Just wanted to keep track of some songs I heard and enjoyed this week.

### [Highasakite - Since Last Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GZHB0v7y6w)

Great sound, accompanying a sadder subject matter.

### [Father John Islands - The Night JOsh Tilman Came To Our Apt](https://play.spotify.com/track/5UXusQhn77o9f11H4NKFbM)

A recommendation from a consistently reliable music source.

Love the subject manner, very reminisce of [Tim Minchin - Storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U)

### [Future Islands - Seasons (Waiting On You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Ae-LhMIG0)

This whole album turned out to be pretty legit today.

The video is something, because Cowboys.
