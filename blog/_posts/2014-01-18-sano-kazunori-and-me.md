Today was a quiet day, I woke early, had breakfast,
went back to sleep, awoke a second time, watched
Adventure Time, and then went for an afternoon run...

With an olymypic skier and general manager of our amazing
hotel [Villa MonRepos](http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g1021352-d1122172-Reviews-Villa_Mon_Repos-Myoko_Niigata_Prefecture_Chubu.html).

And our fantastic translator (from Queensland) Ahdom

It was incredibly humbling to see him bomb past and hit every side,
stopping in the blink of an eye when necessary.

Amy also had the opportunity to grab a few skiing tips from
the man of the hour.

All in all, another amazing day of snowboarding in Myoko, Japan.
