## Slept In

Yesterday was the start of #gymdays (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday/Sunday)
and began at 5:30am. I've decided to go for early and see how I handle it, already
that means I'm getting tired before midnight.

Today though I woke up at 8:00am, and it fealt like a well deserved reward for my work
yesterday. Tonight I'll be heading to bed around midnight, legs in the morning.

## Leveled Up

I joined a service that puts my credit card at risk (I just won't pay the fruad amount,
the card will cover it). However it will cut down on the amount I pay for coffee each day.

Of course they've now sold my information, and of course I set the email I signed up
with to be a tracer address.

Who knows, maybe it won't be so bad<!-- You fool, you've doomed us all! -->.

## Wireless Meraki Configuration

Had some time to play with the Meraki system at work today while debugging a slow
connection. They have a flash LED utility that I found incredibly usefule.

Was able to arrange the icons on the map only after I removed the street address from
them. Unfortunatley the UI wouldn't inform me of this and through the icons into
random locations.

TODO Will need to find out how to report a bug to them.

## Facebook Merge

Finally merged our first InterExchange Department Facebook Page into our
[InterExchange Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/interexchange). Finally
having a reason to use the platform for the good that we do, I'm excited
about how we can build with it.

I don't appreciate Facebook as a user, I have no interest in being segmented
or sold. Other's don't have these convictions, and ultimately the tools they
are building were always going to be there.

The idea that in this free market we can use our money for buying power of an
audience isn't a new concept, it's not inherintely evil. So happy that paying
them for ads gets us a live chat that has so far quickly (couple of hours)
resolved all issues.

## Middleman running the Blog

Over at [InterExchange](https://www.interexchange.org) we're moving our current
[blog](https://blog.interexchange.org) system into our
[Program Landing Pages](https://programs.interexchange.org).

Eventually these will become our website, eventually is estimated at the end of the year,
I'm hoping that's a grave over estimate so that we can get on to real work using
the platform.

Utlimately though getting to Middleman was another big hurdle on a really long journey.

Only thing left to do is import the partials, which is a conversion from jekyll to erb
(love that middleman is just Ruby). And then we'll be able to serve a lot more dynamic
information with the rich content we've amassed.

## Journey on PS4

The fellas informed me that Journey is now on the PS4, got home and immediately downloaded it.

I received the **E-82000113** error when I went to install the game, this was after I had updated
my credit card. I read a lot of solutions, and went through a system rebuild (it didn't take hours,
like 10 minutes).

Finally the solution was to install it on my PS4 from the [Playstation Store](https://store.playstation.com).

There were two copies of Journey? One didn't fix the problem, the other did.

The game is now downloading while I write this post, once again though it's super slow over the Wi-Fi.
This will be resolved when I move back to Ethernet after buying a new TV (consume, consume, reproduce).

## Double Serving of Dinner

Ordered delivery from Beast of Bourbon, they arrived in 15 minutes, instead of the quoted hour and 15.

Turns out it wasn't my order, it was whatever I had ordered doubled.

This worked out really well for me.

I think their ribs are really the only thing you need to get, everything else is a less flavourful.

Can always pull it up yourself and make a sandwich, or gluten free roll, or low carb wrap.

## I have Wine and Video Games

I am out, have a great evening Earth.
