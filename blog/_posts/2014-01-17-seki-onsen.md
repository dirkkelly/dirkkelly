Went to [Seki Onsen](http://www.snowjapan.com/japan-ski-resorts/niigata/myoko/seki-onsen)
with a small set of the group today. 3 runs and 1 lift
kept us more than occupied for a day of fantastic powder.

The better boarders managed to get in some great jumps.

And the lifts were as intimate as they were convenient.
