At this point I have a solid idea of who it is, but with hints this good I'm definitely going to let it play out.

### The Clue


    Hi Dirk!
    Ho Dirk!
    Your Gnome is here to play!

    Hey Dirk!
    Hoo Dirk!
    A poem for you I say!

    A riddle rhyme to pass the time.
    A little line: a secret sign!
    Now can you find the clue that I'm
    unwinding for you? (Middle line!)

    Ha Dirk!
    Hee Dirk!
    I'm near to you indeed!

    How Dirk?
    Who Dirk?
    Your Gnome has done it's deed!

    I've left the seed for you to read
    A tiny weed, a glowing bead!
    And all the rest is chickenfeed!
    So do not heed the call of greed!

    It's only one! The center rung!
    Your gnome's fair song has thus been sung.
    Now take the air into your lung
    and clear your mind of dirt and dung.

    (and by my hint you now be stung.)

### The Answer

I'm near to you indeed!

For those of you playing along at home.

* There's only one important line in this poem.
* There are 23 lines in this poem (go for the capitals)
* Key phrase repeated talks of the Middle line, Center Rung
* 11 lines before, 11 lines after
* Point in fact, last line finally makes the rule true

### What's Gnoming 

It's InterExchange's annual holiday party tradition. I'm to guess who is gifting me a present.

Even though I'm in Australia I'm hoping I'll still be able to participate. Just today I had my Gnoming duties executed by a remote party.
