Tonight my friends went to the [Japanese Fire Festival](bit.ly/1e0h6)
and I hung back out of a lack of interest in cultural exchange.

While I sat their worrying about what my colleagues would say
in response to me avoiding such an activity I went with the
other naysayers to enjoy some Yakiniku and Asahi.

After we were well fed, quite drunk, and had paid our Â¥3,000 ($30)
we started our walk home.

Suddenly, a wild Fire Festival Appears.

The moral of the story, you're on holiday, if you miss an event
don't stress about it and COMME Des FUCKDOWN.
